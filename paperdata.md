Abstract: The globe is at a crossroads in terms of the urban heat island effect, with rising surface tem-
peratures due to urbanization and an expanding built environment. This cause-and-effect connection
may be linked to weather-related dangers, natural disasters, and disease outbreaks. Urbanization and
industrialization will not lead to a secure and sustainable future. Finding solutions to problems such
as the heat island effect is at the forefront of scientific research and policy development. Sustainable
ways to decrease urban heat island impacts are a core principle for urban planners. This literature
study examines the benefits of adding green infrastructure and sustainable materials in built-up areas
to reduce the urban heat island effect. Materials such as reflective street pavements, coating materials
including light-colored paint, phase-change materials, color-changing paint, fluorescence paint, and
energy-efficient appliances are considered sustainable materials, whereas green infrastructure like
green roofs, green walls, green parking and pavements, and shaded streets are considered to mitigate
the urban heat island effect. The hurdles to the widespread adoption of such practices include a
lack of governmental legislation, insufficient technological development, an erroneous estimation of
economic gains, and unwillingness on the part of impacted parties.

1. Introduction
Rapid advancement in the built environment and increasing urbanization are alter-
ing ecosystems and climates, with surface temperature being one of the most influential
factors [1], and increased energy consumption in the urban environment contributes di-
rectly to the rise in surface temperature [2]. Due to urbanization and human activities, the
urban heat island (UHI) effect, which is caused by an increase in surface temperature, is
one of the most severe problems in urban areas [3]. The impact of UHI can be measured by
using the heat and humidity index (THI), the related stress index (RSI), and the number of
Beer Garden days [4]. The UHI effect has a negative influence not only on the environment
but also on the health of the inhabitants. Multiple studies indicate that indigestion is a
common problem, as well as nervous system disorders such as memory loss, depression,
irritability, and sleeplessness [5].
In addition to that, the UHI’s thermal impact may cause a significant circulation of
pollution, resulting in local winds that migrate from suburban to urban areas, bringing city-
contaminated air that is now present in rural areas back to urban areas, worsening urban
air pollution and also increasing the financial burden on city dwellers. The solar radiation

captured by urban surfaces is influenced by factors such as the number of buildings,
their orientation, and the distance between them [6]. The arrangement of buildings has a
significant impact on the distribution of shadows and temperature differences throughout
a city. The canyon-like shape of streetscapes surrounded by high-rise buildings has an
effect on wind patterns in urban canyons due to the intricate heat exchange between the
mass of the buildings and the surrounding atmosphere [7]. Urban heat exchange is affected
by a number of factors, including the thermal characteristics of urban surface materials,
color, texture, and coverage [8].
The lack of vegetation in urban areas increases the amount of heat absorbed by different
components such as buildings, pavement, and roads. Human activities such as driving and
HVAC (heat, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems are also major contributors to heat
accumulation in the atmosphere. Basically, the UHI effect is measured on three different
levels: the ground level, the canopy level, and the urban level [9]. Specifically, the thermal
behavior of surface materials and their exposure to solar radiation impact the UHI effect.
The atmosphere over urban areas can be affected by the emission of heat and subsequent
convectional mixing of the heat [10]. The amount of heat accumulated in the canopy layer
is affected by a number of factors, including the geometry and orientation of open spaces,
the aspect ratio, the sky view factor, the land cover materials, and the direction and velocity
of the wind [11,12].
The urban surface layer’s emitted heat is blended together by turbulence in the air
above the canopy layer of the urban areas [13]. Above the canopy layer, local air is mixed,
leading to the formation of a warm air dome over inhabited areas [14]. Due to the convective
nature of the atmosphere, the urban boundary layer tends to be at its thickest at midnight.
Due to its high heat resistance, the air has a relatively thin surface layer that only goes down
a few centimeters [15]. By late afternoon, when the urban canopy has been heating in the
sun for several hours, the air temperature in the canopy layer has reached its maximum [16].
Although the urban boundary layer is at its thickest in the evening, when warm air is pulled
into the lower atmosphere, it forms a dome of warm air above the urban zone. The rural
boundary layer fluctuates throughout the day, reaching its highest point at the same time
as the day’s highest surface temperature [17].
Responses to the effect of UHIs can be categorized as either adaptation or mitigation.
Adaptations are made to decrease the harm, whereas mitigation is an activity performed to
lessen the intensity or amount of the effect. The UHI effect can be adapted to and mitigated
at the building, neighborhood, municipal, and regional levels. This study is an attempt to
fill a need in the existing literature by offering a synoptic perspective of sustainable green
infrastructure and materials that may be used in urban areas to reduce the UHI impact.
Table 1 presents the background of the strategies reviewed in this study for the mitigation
of UHIs. According to prior research by Shishegar 2014, increasing urban green spaces
like parks, street trees, and green roofs may help reduce the UHI impact [18]. Petzold
and Mose 2023 also undertook a study that investigated the economic and social factors
around urban greening infrastructure [19]. Hence, the results from this study and ensuing
suggestions aim to benefit the built environment in its pursuit of UHI mitigation strategies.
Consequently, presented herein is the specific scope of the study:
• Identifying suitable green infrastructure that can be incorporated within the built-up
areas in the urban setting.
• The identification of sustainable materials that can be integrated with building compo-
nents to reduce the UHI effect.
• Examining the principle behind those identified techniques and their effectiveness in
implementation.
• Identifying the most prevalent obstacles to the widespread implementation of the
identified UHI mitigation strategies in urban areas and proposing solutions to
these problems.

the urban environment. Section 4 examines the obstacles to applying these sustainable
strategies in urban settings. Finally, a summary of the study is presented and conclusions
are drawn in the last section.

2. Materials and Methods
The issue of UHIs and sustainable mitigation practices is gaining relevance among
individuals residing in densely populated urban areas. Global industrial and development
activities have led to an increased emphasis on environmental sustainability, which marks
a departure from past practices. Given the escalating expenses associated with the UHI
phenomenon, it is imperative to prioritize the identification of sustainable measures aimed
at mitigating its adverse impacts. Despite the fact that a number of studies have already
been conducted to identify sustainable green strategies, this study will concentrate on
a variety of urban-specific strategies that incorporate the built environment. This study
reviewed over 315 documents to gather the recent literature; however, 163 were irrelevant to
the study’s objectives and out-of-date. Consequently, they were excluded. Table 2 presents
detailed descriptions of the reviewed articles and the details from various academic sources
(ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, etc.). UHI, UHI mitigation methods, the
built environment and green infrastructure, and climate change were all used as search
keywords for relevant papers.
Figure 1 describes the methodology undertaken to conduct this study. First, a literature
study was conducted in order to bring to light many problems that have been associated
with the UHI. Extensive explanations are given of global sustainable programs that have
adopted innovative methods in lieu of more conventional ones. Methods for protecting
against solar heating are explored, such as using green roofs, living walls, green façades,
innovative road and pavement designs, coatings made from paint, phase-change materials,
color-change materials, fluorescence materials, and sun shade. The adoption of more
energy-efficient appliances in favor of older, less efficient models is another method of
reducing the UHI’s impact on the environment. Finally, the limitations and constraints of
commonly used solutions for mitigating the effects of UHIs have been highlighted.Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 p p

3. Incorporation of Green Infrastructure into Buildings
Green infrastructure is the addition of blue (water) and green (vegetation) components
in contrast to the constructed environment to improve and manage environmental systems
to enhance the quality of life in the ecosystem [20]. These green assets, if well-planned
and designed, could mitigate the negative impacts of urban heat islands (UHIs) and
climate change while also improving residents’ quality of life. Green infrastructure is
the strategic approach to developing and optimizing sustainable management systems
of urban natural ecosystems in the face of climate change challenges. Innovative and
well-developed potential practices can be considered by urban planners inside the built
environment, including the implementation of green strategies into the main components,
such as rooftops, façades, parking areas for buildings, pavements, walls, and landscaping
areas to reduce the UHI effect with sustainable green and blue concepts.
Given the limited land resources, significantly increasing the density of green space is
a challenging task. As a result, enhancing the spatial arrangement of green space could be
a viable option. The significance of green space in mitigating urban heat islands (UHIs) is
attributed to its spatial characteristics, including size, composition, and configuration [21].
As such, it is important that the unique qualities and characteristics be taken into account
throughout planning, construction, and maintenance [22]. The environmental sector is
put to the test by green infrastructure, which calls for a holistic and environmentally
friendly strategy that integrates more concerns. Pressures may also be felt regarding the
growing concerns of energy demand, consumption, and production, all of which have
direct and indirect effects on the environmental facet of developing building infrastructure.
Heat gain and loss are major factors on roofs since they represent the greatest exposed
space. Traditional roofing practices using a variety of materials have contributed to the
excessive heat buildup within structures and in the immediate vicinity [23]. As a result,
many regions of the globe are becoming familiar with the practice of initiating green
roofing approaches by using greenery techniques and regulating the excessive heat and
heat variations surrounding the plants.Sustainability 2023, 15, 10767 7 of 26
Façades are huge potential vertical spaces on structures, and these areas will expand
as the buildings rise in height. Despite the vertical openness to the surroundings, the UHI
effect is significantly impacted by façades due to the solar heat absorption potential and
heat release from nearby buildings [24]. The streets and paving systems around a structure
are essential in making it accessible to the public. The UHI impact is influenced by the
layout of streets and pavement, including whether they are exposed to or sheltered from
the sun, as well as by nearby buildings and other factors. The right planning of roadways
and pavements, as well as the inclusion of sustainable flora, is crucial. As a result, the
introduction of novel green infrastructure techniques into high-rise buildings and a full
investigation of the seriousness of all these components via past literature studies are
required for the present situation. Each facet of green infrastructure is examined in depth
in this section.
3.1. Green Roofing Techniques
A green roofing system is one of the useful tools for reducing the UHI effect by cooling
the surrounding atmosphere. The built environment is being built at the expense of parks
and other green spaces as a result of rapid urbanization [25]. This leads to a scarcity of
vegetation, which reduces canopy interception and transpiration within the city, raising
temperatures and lowering humidity [26]. Changing the characteristics of rooftops can help
alleviate some of these issues. The addition of vegetation and soil to unused rooftop spaces
is typically seen as a good method for making buildings more environmentally friendly [27].
Hence, green roofs are just rooftops that have had vegetation transplanted onto a growing
medium. Benefits to the buildings’ aesthetics, the environment, and the economy can be
gained by encouraging the development of green roofs. Vegetation, substrate, filter fabric,
drainage material, a root barrier, and insulation are the components that comprise a green
roof [28]. Figure 2 shows the typical layers of a green roof system.
Substituting man-made, impermeable surfaces in built environment areas is the pri-
mary driver of UHIs [29]. Vegetation holds water in order for it to be evaporated back
into the air through evapotranspiration, which not only cools the vegetated surface and
low-level atmosphere but also lowers the amount of energy held in urban materials and
released as heat [30]. Latent heat results from the transformation of evapotranspiration
energy into the cooling of water vapor molecules in the higher atmosphere [31]. Rainwater
evaporation converts some of the solar energy into latent heat, but hard, non-porous sur-
faces still collect most of the solar radiation and radiate them as heat. Roofs that are too
warm boost the UHI but also allow more heat into a building, leading to higher indoor
temperatures [10].
Rising temperatures also raise the peak loads required to meet the requirements for air
conditioning and refrigeration, which can result in increased emissions of greenhouse gases
(GHGs), and other pollutants [32]. Green roofs may provide additional benefits to building
occupants and city dwellers, including reduced heating and cooling costs and increased
durability of roof membranes due to temperature fluctuations [33]. Reduced stormwater
runoff and combined sewage overflow, which occurs when the sewer system is flushed
during extreme rainfall events, are also added benefits of green roofing. Green roofs can
be either intensive or extensive. Intensive green roofs have a thick substrate layer, a large
diversity of plants, high upkeep, high capital cost, and a higher weight; therefore, they
usually require a lot of maintenance in the form of fertilizing, weeding, and watering [34].
However, extensive green roofs have a thin substrate layer, low capital cost, low weight,
and minimal upkeep. Extensive green roof systems are often employed when no further
structural support is required [34].
Part of the water that falls on a green roof is absorbed by the developing substrate or is
held in pore spaces. Vegetation can take water in and either store it in their tissues or release
it back into the air through a process called transpiration. The remaining water is sent into
the drainage system after passing through the filter cloth. Water will be held back since it
can be stored in the granules’ pores or the drainage modules’ compartments. One of theSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 and watering [34]. However, extensive green roofs have a thin substrate layer, low capital

3.3. Green Parking, Pavements and Shaded Streets
One such method of reducing UHIs is through increasing tree cover and creating
shade. Trees’ leaf density, leaf area, and evapotranspiration all have a role, as do their
geometric qualities. Urban temperatures and land surface elevations may be stabilized to
some degree by the careful planning and design of urban landscaping and green areas [47].
During the summer, the amount of solar energy absorbed is decreased as the percent-
age of vegetative cover increases, especially if the canopy index is high [48]. Trees in
urban regions face a number of challenges due to impervious cover, poor soil moisture,
nutritional scarcity, a lack of rooting volume, water/air pollution, and transport-related
toxicity [49]. The longevity of tree populations in cities is further affected by factors such
as low-temperature pressures, anthropogenic heat sources, air turbulence, and high windSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 11 of 26
speed owing to urban canyons [50]. Tree species vary in their evapotranspiration rates, heat,
and drought tolerance based on a number of factors including morphology, physiology,
local water supply, and wind velocity. Although pavement surface temperatures are raised
by direct solar radiation, they are lowered by tree canopies. As the amount of asphalt,
concrete, and other impermeable surfaces grows, the overnight temperatures rise [51].
Improvements in nighttime urban warming mitigation may be achieved by the elimination
of non-permeable surfaces.
Increasing the ratio of impervious surfaces to canopy cover is an important mitigating
technique. Solar radiation through the canopy helps keep the ground below at a constant
temperature. Pavement undergoes a freezing and thawing cycle as a result of nighttime
heat loss and temperature drops. Cracks in the pavement form as a result of the pavement’s
exposure to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing [52]. As the rate of pavement degrada-
tion rises, the pavement’s useful life decreases. Trees may reduce daytime temperatures,
which in turn reduces the temperature gradients between the road and the surrounding
landscape. The pavement’s durability is increased as a result of this [53]. The UHI may be
mitigated by urban shade because it lowers local temperatures and slows down the rate at
which heat is conducted away from surfaces. The geometry, structure, leaf size, and canopy
cover density of trees are all quantifiable factors in urban shade.
Creating tree-shaded areas improves occupants’ thermal comfort inside the built
environment in hot climates [5]. Trees with a wide canopy may block solar radiation and
the rays reflected off concrete, asphalt, glass, and other man-made surfaces. The quality
of shade may be enhanced by increasing canopy leaf area, size, density, projection, and
transmissivity [54]. Shade may cut down on heat intake from buildings and other structures,
as well as on heat exchange and surface temperatures. Leaf structure, epidermal features,
and angle all have a role in reflectance. A foliar canopy affects absorption, and it is most
often assessed by calculating the leaf-area index, chlorophyll content, and water content of
the plant [55]. The quantity of solar radiation that penetrates a canopy may be measured
using a dimensionless ratio such as transmissivity, which is affected by the structure of
the canopy [56].
A variety of mechanisms, including reflection, absorption, and transmission, allow
trees and other plants to diffuse solar radiation. Part of the solar energy that is taken in
is used for photosynthesis, while the rest is transformed into heat [57]. This is because
the leaves warm up as they absorb more heat. Water from the leaf is turned into water
vapor and exhaled into the atmosphere via the stomata. Water vapor is converted during
the conversion process, which results in the leaf cooling as a result of the loss of latent
heat [58]. Plants are able to chill the air around them by taking in carbon dioxide during
photosynthesis and exhaling it during transpiration. When combined with shade, this
technique causes an overall cooling of the environment throughout the summer [59].
The peak air temperature is higher in open terrain than in vegetative areas. Suburbs
devoid of mature trees tend to be warmer than their tree-lined counterparts [59]. It is
warmer on barren ground than in irrigated areas and it is warmer on artificial turf pitches
than on grass grounds. The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a metric for measuring the impact of
trees on urban surface temperatures. This establishes a connection between the amount of
greenery present and the amount of water lost to evaporation in urban settings [60]. Several
factors, including tree species, age, hydraulic state, vapor pressure deficit, soil nutrient
availability, seasonal changes, groundwater conditions, and wind speed, all play a part in
determining the LAI [61].
There are techniques to include water storage in paving systems, allowing for the use
of evaporative cooling on roads, parking areas, and sidewalks [62]. Cooler temperatures
are maintained on water-retentive pavements because less solar energy is converted to
heat through conduction. There are several types of water-repellent pavements, including
porous pavers, permeable pavers, and pervious pavers [63]. Water permeates porous
pavers through tiny holes in their surface. These pavers typically include a cellular grid
design, and the holes within the grid are filled with moisture-retaining materials [64]. GrassSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 12 of 26
is a great choice for infill because it promotes transpiration from the root to the shoot of
the plant and brings moisture from the ground up to the surface, where it can evaporate
and cool the pavements below [65]. In contrast to previous and porous choices, permeable
pavers allow water to flow over their surface rather than through them and are made from
concrete or kiln-fired clay bricks [66]. In order to facilitate the evaporation of surface water,
a path is made between pavers by the use of spacer lugs or small holes. It was about as
warm as concrete during the day and about as cool as asphalt at night, making this paver
an ideal alternative. It follows that the evaporative cooling effect of permeable pavers
is marginal.
4. Sustainable Materials for UHI Effect Mitigation
The incorporation of sustainable building materials into the built environment is
another key contributor to the UHI impact. The building’s preconstruction, construction,
and finishing materials all contribute considerably. Streets and pavements composed of
impermeable and highly heat-absorbent materials, painting materials with high thermal
effects, and utility efficiency appliances that release high heat and GHGs contribute sig-
nificantly to UHI effects. Sustainable construction materials are not only economically
feasible but also minimize harmful emissions and UHI effects, hence minimizing the total
environmental impact. Buildings should make use of environmentally friendly building
materials and technologies in a manner that is suitable and contextual. Locally made or
obtained construction materials qualify as sustainable. These items comprise recycled and
industrial byproducts and waste materials. Sustainable materials are thermally efficient
and have a lesser environmental effect. The manufacturing of these building materials takes
much less energy than the production of contemporary or conventional building materials.
4.1. Innovative Streets and Pavement Systems
The idea of adopting novel pavements to reduce the UHI effect has gained popu-
larity in recent years in highly populated regions. In order to produce cool pavements,
conventional pavements may make use of already available pavement technologies by
modifying the materials, implementing sustainable strategies, or introducing brand-new
materials [67,68]. If a pavement increases solar reflectance ability, increases the evapora-
tion process, or decreases the release of sensible heat into the urban atmosphere, then it
will remain cooler than traditional pavement [53]. Cool pavements are categorized into
reflective, evaporative, and heat-harvesting pavements [62]. In order to reduce the surface
temperature and sensible heat emission, reflective pavements have a higher albedo than
regular pavements. Evaporative pavements are those that retain water at the surface or in
the subsurface for the purpose of evaporative cooling. Subduing the surface temperature,
heat-harvesting pavements collect energy from the sun and use it for other purposes. The
topic of cool pavements has expanded beyond pavement cooling technology to include the
impact of such pavements on the weather in cities [69].
Paving materials that are designed to keep temperatures down, such as those that
are reflective of light, increase the rate at which water evaporates or have some other
cooling effect [70]. It will always be colder than standard asphalt, and it will radiate
less heat into the atmosphere. Since the hottest time of the day typically occurs in the
summer, when the release of sensible heat is crucial to the formation of the UHI, a cool
pavement must be able to reduce its daily maximum temperature [29]. Pavements that
have been sealed with a material that is reflective of light will have less of an impact on the
environment [71]. A sealed surface is created by pressing finely graded aggregates into a
thin layer of hot bitumen that has been spread over an existing pavement [61]. Due to the
aggregates being partly exposed, the surface albedo should be somewhere between that
of the asphalt binder and that of the aggregates themselves [72]. Solar reflection is shown
to be highly dependent on the aggregate’s color and the pavement’s age [73]. Chip seal
pavement’s albedo is observed to decline with age yet remains higher than that of regular
asphalt concrete [74]. Although generating white slurry seal requires re-formulating theSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 13 of 26
emulsifier and increasing the price, it has limited applications because of the increased
albedo the pavement receives from it [75]. It is also possible to greatly improve asphalt
pavement’s reflectivity by the use of other methods, such as painting with light colors or
micro surfacing with light-colored materials [76].
Incorporating white cementitious materials and light-colored pebbles into concrete
mixes can create highly reflective pavements [77]. The albedo of hydrated concrete is
principally determined by the cement’s solar reflectance, with other ingredients playing a
supporting role. Although the addition of fly ash, which reacts with calcium hydroxide to
produce stronger concrete, can decrease albedo slightly, it can also increase longevity [78].
The solar reflecting ability can be altered by a wetting, soiling, and abrasion process after
being exposed [79]. The reflectivity of the fine aggregates and paste is what primarily
determines the albedo in the aged state. High reflectivity can also be seen in white topping
and roller-compacted pavements. Streets with minimal traffic in urban areas may have a
white overlay of only two to four inches thick [80].
Although reflective pavements keep the heat off in the summer, they can have the
opposite effect in the winter by making the road surface colder [81]. During the summer, a
pavement surface with high reflection is preferable, while a surface with low reflectance
during the winter is preferable. Due to a reversible molecular structure transition that
occurs at elevated temperatures, the albedo of thermochromic materials shifts when their
surfaces warm and cool [82]. Thermochromic substances and their doses can affect the
transition temperature. Adding TiO2 to this thermochromic coating could increase its
reflectivity [83]. When thermochromic pigments were added to asphalt binder, it was
discovered that the binder retained its temperature more effectively in both hot and cold
climates [84]. Similarly, it was discovered that cement paste with thermochromic pigments
could maintain a colder temperature in hot conditions and a warmer temperature in cold
environments than plain concrete paste [65]. Thermochromic materials can be impregnated
into concrete; however, this process may reduce the concrete’s strength.
Therefore, the ability of permeable pavement to maintain a low temperature depends
on whether or not the evaporative flux is greater than the extra heat uptake brought about
by the pavement’s low thermal inertia [85]. A pervious paver is a porous concrete that
allows water to flow through it instead of collecting and pooling on the surface. Large,
uniform-sized aggregates are coated with a concrete paste or asphalt binder to create
pervious concrete [86]. Since the pavement systems drain easily, the permeable pavers in
this concrete do not collect or hold too much percolating water. Pervious pavements have
been found to be as hot as black asphalt pavements on sunny summer days because of their
higher solar radiation absorption and lower heat inertia than conventional pavements [87].
Pervious pavements may be considered cool pavements due to their lower temperature at
night and their ability to cool faster than regular concrete. This is because the roughness
of the pervious surface reduces its albedo, allowing it to soak up more solar energy than
regular concrete would. When compared to conventional concrete pavement, pervious
concrete pavement has a lower solar reflectance index [88]. When compared to regular
concrete, pervious concrete is reported to have a lower thermal inertia. The texture of
pervious concrete is coarser than that of regular concrete. With a higher heat convective
coefficient, this concrete could be more effective in dissipating heat in breezy conditions [89].
Unless the pervious concrete is re-wetted at a suitable time, the evaporation of the
preceding concrete adds relatively little to the decrease in surface temperature [90]. Too
much water seeps through pervious concrete too quickly for it to be effective at prevent-
ing evaporation. Adequate water is required for evaporative cooling and water-holding
pavements, which retain most of their moisture in the surface layer [76]. Water-retentive
pavements differ from permeable pavements in their pore structure and evaporative ca-
pacity. Water-retentive fillers are often incorporated into concrete to increase its capacity
to store water. A water-retentive pavement is one that, when saturated, can hold onto
rainwater for a period of time by using specific filler materials [91]. In addition, when the
evaporated water close to the surface is gone, the water-retentive filler’s pore structureSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 14 of 26
can draw water from the base via capillary force. After being watered, the dry surface of a
water-retentive block can absorb water at a rate greater than its absorptivity [65]. Refilling
water-retentive pavements with wastewater is one strategy for increasing their resistance
to evaporation [92]. Wastewater is sprinkled on water-retentive pavements in some places
to extend the cooling effect of evaporation. The use of high absorptive infill and recycled
water for irrigation both assist keep pavements at a more comfortable temperature than the
vegetation around them [93].
4.2. Various Coating Materials
4.2.1. Painting with Light-Colored Materials
One potential solution to the UHI effect is the use of solar-reflective coatings for the
building envelope [94]. Extensive global modeling and field studies have confirmed that
highly reflective materials, when combined with thermal energy storage and conservation
measures, are an effective strategy to combat the UHI effect [95]. Traditional cool materials
with diffuse reflectance do not appear to resolve concerns connected to rising urban density,
such as the proximity of buildings and canyon phenomena [96]. As a matter of fact, with a
diffusive nature, some of the reflection will be absorbed by nearby structures. The favorable
effect they have on UHIs is also mitigated since reflected radiation from diffuse vertical
surfaces is absorbed more strongly by pavements and roads [97]. The ability of retro-
reflective (RR) materials to redirect light to their original source is a useful and unique
attribute. RR materials are now used for traffic safety applications such as road signs and
work clothing but are not commercially available for use as building coatings [98]. Coating
urban patterns with RR materials may mitigate UHIs by reducing the amount of sunlight
that is reflected to nearby structures and roads [99].
Currently, high reflectance coatings made from acrylic materials, elastomeric, sili-
cone, fluoropolymer, or mixtures thereof, are widely utilized globally to mitigate the UHI
impact [8]. Several highly reflective artificial coatings may be far cooler than naturally oc-
curring white materials but still a few degrees warmer than the ambient temperature [100].
The solar reflectance, emissivity value, and thermal capacity of white reflective materials
all contribute to the surface temperature range that these materials exhibit. Hence, most
white reflective coatings deteriorate and lose their luster, which is a major issue for the
industry [101]. A further problem with white coatings is that they allow bacteria to multiply
rapidly on the surface [102]. Roof washing can restore some of the roofing material’s optical
qualities but may reduce its reflectivity. White reflective coatings lose their reflectivity
months to years after they are applied.
Many factors, including the coatings’ composition and treatment, as well as the sur-
rounding environment, affect optical performance and the likelihood of an increase in
optical durability [103]. Compared to white paints made with organic binders, those made
with inorganic components are more optically stable and have higher solar reflectance and
emissivity. It has been discovered that doping titanium dioxide with Al, Li, or K signifi-
cantly improves the photostability of the coatings without affecting their reflectance [8].
The coatings’ self-cleaning characteristics and optical performance are both improved by
the incorporation of photocatalytic technology. When titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles
are incorporated into a coating, the deposited organic substances are broken down into
sulfate, water, nitrate, and carbon dioxide, which are then washed off by water cleaning
or rain [104].
This drastically reduces the adhesion of bacteria to the coating’s surface. The surface
temperatures of white, man-made materials with high reflectivity and emissivity are only
slightly higher than the surrounding air temperature. Since they dramatically lower the
emission of sensible heat into the atmosphere, they are very helpful in preventing cities from
becoming uncomfortably hot. An important downside of highly reflecting white materials
is that their optical and thermal performance may degrade significantly with age [105].
There are a variety of mitigation solutions that make use of commercially available colored,
spectrally selective materials with high spectral reflectivity in the near-infrared wavelengthSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 15 of 26
range and a high emissivity value. Materials that reflect infrared rays have a much higher
solar reflectance compared to materials of the same color and type [106].
To boost reflectivity, scientists have turned to polymeric inorganic hybrid materials and
organic or inorganic pigments with near-infrared spectrum reflectivity [107]. Pigments that
reflect infrared light and are made from inorganic materials have superior optical stability,
great durability, and high temperature stability. Heavy metals in pigments could be bad for
the environment. For the most part, the melt blending procedures of polymeric inorganic
hybrid materials are less harmful to the environment [108]. Infrared-reflecting pigments
can be used with any solvent, including those used to dissolve polyesters, fluoropolymers,
and acrylics, as well as those used in water-based coating chemistry [109]. When pigments
are combined with binders and other compounds, a coating can be created. It is reflective
because the coating’s pigment has a different refractive index in the infrared spectrum than
the binder.
On the other hand, if the coating’s transparency to infrared (IR) radiation is not af-
fected by the difference between the IR refractive indexes of the pigment and binder, then
the coating will be transparent to IR radiation [110]. When trying to generate a reflective
surface, infrared reflective coatings can be put directly over any material, while infrared-
transmitting coatings require a near-infrared reflecting background. A near-infrared trans-
mission coating can be applied when the substrate has a high IR reflectance; however, a
white basecoat and an IR-transmitting coating can be applied instead when the substrate is
absorbing [111]. The reflectance of the substrate, the thickness of the coating, the roughness
of the surface, and the possible backscattering of the pigments all play major roles in
determining the composite material’s spectral reflectance [112].
The optical properties of the pigments, binder refractive index, pigment volume
concentration, and particle size all have a role in regulating this. However, the near-infrared
(NIR) and solar reflectance of cool coatings are observed to increase with the thickness of
the white base coat and can reach a maximum constant value above a specific thickness,
suggesting that smoothing the rough surface of the materials boosts reflectivity across
all wavelengths. Roofing and paving materials can receive IR reflective coatings [113].
IR--reflecting materials have a far lower surface temperature than traditional materials
of the same color, allowing for less sensible heat to be released and significantly less
urban hyperthermia as a result [114]. The emittance and solar reflectance of IR-reflecting
materials exposed to the external environment are diminished due to weathering, aging,
and soiling [115].
4.2.2. Phase-Change Materials (PCMs)
Another tactic for minimizing the UHI effect is the use of PCMs that store and re-
lease latent heat to boost the apparent thermal capacity of buildings and urban structures
and lower their peak surface temperatures. Most PCMs are noncorrosive, nontoxic, and
compatible with a wide range of other materials used in asphalt and concrete pavement
and roofing goods, and they can be categorized as either organic, inorganic, or eutectic
mixes [116]. With the help of PCMs, asphaltic pavements are less likely to experience
thermally-induced rutting and cracking, and the viscoelastic qualities of asphalt binders
are less likely to degrade [8]. Concrete pavements’ resistance to cracking, curling strains,
hydration processes, and thermal shrinkage can all be enhanced by using PCMs [117]. It is
feasible to reduce the surface temperature of pavements and release the stored energy at a
later time by including PCMs within the pavement’s mass [118].
The amount of PCMs in the entire mixture, the phase-change materials employed, the
method used to incorporate PCMs into the pavement, the thermal and optical characteristics
of the pavement materials, and the local climatic circumstances all influence how much the
surface temperature can be lowered [119]. The thermal capacity and the heat transmission
quality of the pavements are both affected by the volume percentage of the PCMs [120].
Because of the low conductivity in the liquid phase, PCMs impede heat transfer in the mass
of the pavement, leading to higher surface temperatures even as their presence in the mixSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 16 of 26
increases the possibility for latent heat storage and hence reduces surface temperatures [94].
Choosing the PCM melting point is important because it determines how long it takes to
heat up the pavement to its maximum temperature and how fast it cools down again [121].
The melting temperature selection should be based on the local climate and the thermal
balance of the pavement [122]. It is possible to use many PCMs, some of which have quite
varied melting points. When used in construction or urban planning materials, PCMs
pose a serious leakage danger when in their molten condition [123]. Micro-encapsulation,
macro-encapsulation, and porous inclusion are among the preferred ways of putting them
into construction materials [119].
4.2.3. Color-Changing Materials
Materials that undergo a thermochromic color change in response to temperature can,
for example, be bright and reflective in the summer and dark and absorbing in the win-
ter. A wide variety of thermochromic materials, including thermochromic combinations,
with a wide range of color-changing mechanisms, are known. Sol-gel films’ lumines-
cence shifts [124], surface plasmon absorption [125], liquid–crystal phase transitions [126],
dye–dye and dye–polymer aggregation and disaggregation mechanisms [127], photonic
crystals’ refractive index modulation [128], and pH changes [129] are the most common ex-
amples of the many known mechanisms. Thermochromic pigments and leuco dyes require
the use of three distinct components: a solvent that regulates the color-change temperature;
a color former such as spirolactone, spiropyran, triphenylmethane, or fluorane; and a color
developer [130]. At the melting point of the thermochromic substance, the solvent turns
from a solid to a liquid, allowing the developer and the color former to dissolve into it [131].
Thermochromic systems lose their color when the hydrogen bonds between the solvent
and the color former are severed [132]. In thermochromic materials, the solvent reverts to
the solid phase and the color former regains its original color when the temperature drops
below the freezing point [133]. Leuco dyes’ color transition temperature is easily modifiable
by experimenting with various dyes and solvents. By combining different thermochromic
ingredients, it is possible to create thermochromic mixes with more than one color change.
Without damaging their color-changing characteristics, the composites can change from
gray to pink, green to blue, and white at temperatures close to 24◦C [8]. It is the molar
ratios of the three components in the thermochromic mixture, as well as their chemical
properties, that determine the color quality and thermochromic qualities of leuco dye-based
materials [134]. Important issues with aging arise with thermochromic materials based on
the use of leuco dyes because of fading and the loss of reversibility. Molecular oxygen is
reduced and reactive oxygen species are produced in an irreversible photochemical process
triggered by ultraviolet (UV) radiation [135]. There is a great possibility for mitigation in
the built environment from thermochromic materials.
4.2.4. Fluorescence Materials
One of the creative strategies that may be used in UHI impact mitigation procedures
is to capture the photovoltaic energy of solar radiation, release the light emission, and
aid in increasing the surface’s ability to reflect light [8]. There are two different kinds
of fluorescent substances: bulk fluorescent substances like ruby and nano-fluorescent
substances like quantum dots [134]. Combining a polymer with a colloidal quantum dot
solution is an alternate method for depositing quantum dots on a substrate. By using this
method, the danger of luminous deterioration brought on by the aggregation of quantum
dots is reduced [136]. Quantum dots and fluorescent materials offer a great opportunity to
reduce the UHI effect.
Some pigments have shown promise for effective fluorescence and look to be econom-
ically and enduringly viable. Ruby, an aluminum oxide pigment with chromium added,
was the first of its kind. It is useful for making things in shades of red and pink [137].
Another option is calcium copper tetra-silicate with either barium (Ba) or strontium (Sr) in
place of the calcium, the finest results to yet have been obtained with calcium and strontiumSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 17 of 26
compounds [138]. The near-infrared fluorescence is preserved throughout the mixing pro-
cess. A coating of synthetic rubies, with its rich dark red hue and fluorescence advantage,
is a positive sight [139]. These pigments are alkaline earth copper silicates, which are often
manufactured using solid-state chemical methods. In a nutshell, the oxides or carbonates of
the component metals are well mixed and then heated in air to a temperature approaching
900 ◦C for a few hours [140]. It is common for the dark compound copper oxide to remain
as an impurity after the synthesis. The pigment will be gray instead of blue if there is an
excess of copper oxide [141].
4.3. Use of Energy-Efficient Appliances
The energy used by buildings and the one-third of all GHG emissions they account for
are both significant contributors to UHIs. Reducing energy consumption and running costs
and lowering greenhouse gas emissions across the life cycle of buildings requires proper
building design and construction, the sufficient use of energy sources, and the discovery of
innovative materials [142]. Climate parameters and climate zones are crucial in adjusting
to and minimizing the impacts of UHIs since they influence so many elements of building
design and operation [143]. New energy budgets must be established, and the energy
efficiency of buildings and whole cities must be improved. Taking climate dynamism into
consideration throughout the building design process is crucial because it allows for more
accurate sizing of residential hot water, heating, and cooling systems, as well as more
thoughtful material selection [144]. To achieve a building design that reduces the negative
impacts of UHI while still adapting to the urban environment, codes and standards must
be flexible enough to accommodate changing circumstances.
Thus, it is important to establish new climatic zones and formulate suggestions to
provide appropriate thermal conditions for future epochs. The construction industry
has a unique potential to cut down on waste disposal and resource consumption via
the development of economically and ecologically sustainable materials based on the
integration of secondary materials as alternatives. Appliances that reduce energy use have
an enormous impact on these two important environmental goals. Materials that quickly
disperse energy are highly valued in the quest for efficiency and the mitigation of carbon
emissions. However, domestic energy savings are reliant on users’ technical and habitual
behavior; in fact, energy-efficient home appliances provide better energy efficiency and
sustainability than the habitual adjustment of turning off appliances when not in use [145].
5. Challenges in Implementing UHI Mitigation Strategies
Despite the fact that a great deal of work is being done to find solutions to the problem
of the UHI in highly urbanized regions where environmental concerns are paramount,
there are still certain practical limitations that are encountered by the initiators. The lack of
government legislation, inadequate technology, an inaccurate estimate of the economic ad-
vantages, and reluctance on the part of individuals are all examples of these limitations. The
largest problem is the government’s lack of policies aimed at reducing UHIs and providing
direction to those who would want to implement such efforts. As previously indicated,
government policies are the single most effective tool for advancing urban sustainability
programs [146]. Yet, ineffective government initiatives may dampen public excitement.
However, while being aware of the environmental, economic, and social advantages
of implementing sustainable initiatives in a voluntary manner, developers and private
sectors sometimes find it difficult to use newly offered technology. The failure to regularly
update the local experience and feedback report is also cited as a serious challenge. Despite
the obvious advantages to business, local governments in certain nations continue to
enact policies that are harmful to the environment [147]. Companies in the private sector
are often hesitant to take on such initiatives because they fear failure in the absence of
adequate government oversight and funding [148]. Although there has been a lot of
attention on innovation and technical progress in the research studies, there are still several
technological roadblocks that prevent widespread implementation. While each city hasSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 18 of 26
its own unique characteristics from its climate to its high concentration of urban features,
different applications must be adapted to work in each one.
Building characteristics, roof pitches, plant types, and other accessibility variables
all put constraints on the available options. To provide one example, the roofs of older
buildings are not designed to support considerable weight; therefore, only a large system
with low structural loading may be employed. However, the lightweight and expansive
mechanism is unable to withstand much wind. Furthermore, urban floods, the UHI phe-
nomena, and the diminishment of urban landscapes are all primarily driven by the growth
in buildings and pavement. Numerous cities are dominated by skyscrapers; however, these
structures almost never have any roof space left over for greenery because of the presence
of expensive and necessary construction services. In addition, green roof plants may attract
mosquitoes and other pests, which can cause problems for nearby households. Metals
like aluminum, copper, zinc, and iron, used in roofing, may contribute to environmental
degradation if they are not used appropriately [149].
Many advantages, including those related to protecting the environment, enhancing
biodiversity, and enhancing occupants’ quality of life, cannot be evaluated in terms of
economic returns and hence act as a barrier to adoption by developers and the private sector.
However, there are challenges in calculating the economic advantages of UHI reduction
owing to a lack of appropriate resources and improper auditing methods. Meanwhile,
prices increase. The upfront costs of designing, building, maintaining, and watering
such a roof might be more than conventional roofs [34]. Dislike might emerge from
a lack of understanding and knowledge about the repayment time frame. Economic
gains are complicated by the widely varying lengths of time it takes to get a return on
investment [150]. The time it takes to recoup the investment made in a large project is a
drawback despite the fact that it may ultimately save money [151]. A major roadblock is the
reluctance of designers and developers to implement new tactics, mostly due to concerns
that locals will not like them and the resulting excess of unnecessary space. This issue
emphasizes the need for a more informed and supportive public.
6. Discussion
The UHI effect and its harmful effects from built environments inside urban areas
were detailed in this study. It is obvious that the conventional methods of construction
and the rapidly rising number of buildings in urban areas have exacerbated environmental
challenges. Multiple initiatives are now conducting research and development to identify
the optimal solution for low-impact architecture and design of buildings and built envi-
ronments that will also minimize the UHI effect. This research focused on two primary
strategies: the incorporation of green infrastructure into the built environment and its
components and the use of sustainable materials in buildings. Green infrastructure, such as
green roofs, green façades, green parking, green roadways, and green pavements, were con-
sidered and examined. Incorporating plants and the evapotranspiration of plants, reducing
the heat impact and increasing the cooling nature of the environment, and also adding
value to the green space and protecting the ecosystem, green roofing has been identified as
a potential solution to conventional roofing systems by attaching plants and regulating the
thermal effect within the building interior and the near surroundings of the building.
However, this has also brought about some unfavorable outcomes, such as providing a
safe haven for insects and certain dangerous reptiles and necessitating the implementation
of remedies to problems like water leaks and root penetration in the structure. In contrast,
green façades use the vertical surface area of the structure and may be used without
affecting the building’s performance. Similar to green roofs, green walls and living walls
are a kind of vertical garden seen on high-rise buildings. Others are framed and connected
to the buildings rather than the façades themselves. Green roofing and other forms of direct
façade attachment have been linked to structural damage and water leakage, although
these problems may be mitigated if the right preventative measures and repair methodsSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 19 of 26
are used [152]. However, such damage caused by plants may be avoided in the case of
frame-supported façades, although doing so may lead to increased expenses.
It is true that the designers of sustainable green buildings are being urged to cut
down on parking spaces in an effort to limit the number of individual vehicles used.
However, in certain circumstances, parking spaces are essential and the number of vehicles
is unavoidable due to insufficient public transit options. With the use of tree canopies
and highly reflecting indexing paint, parking lots may be made more environmentally
friendly and less detrimental to the environment. This will cause plants to produce a
cooling action known as evapotranspiration. Pavement and road designs that include
vegetation to minimize heat gain, promote water infiltration and percolation, and decrease
the UHI impact are preferable from an environmental and economic perspective. The heat
absorption of a building and the UHI effect are both largely attributable to the materials
used in construction [143]. The thermal impact of the materials, including their absorption
and reflection of heat, must be carefully examined throughout the construction process.
Using sustainable construction practices and sustainable building materials in high-rise
structures is the most effective way to mitigate the UHI impact. By using highly reflective
paint, you may limit the amount of heat absorbed by a building’s exterior.
Incorporating phase-change materials into construction allows for the absorption
and storage of thermal energy through a phase transition. Because of this, the ambient
temperature drops. Color-changing materials can be white during times of high solar
radiation, increasing reflectivity and decreasing heat gain, and black during times of low
solar radiation and low temperatures inside the building, absorbing heat and lowering the
need for heating, both of which help to lower GHG emissions and the UHI. By doing so,
the fluorescence effect is achieved and the heat gain of the building is decreased thanks to
the incorporation of fluorescence materials into the building components. GHG emissions
may be lowered and energy use can be lowered by using appliances that are more energy-
efficient. In this way, it is not only worthwhile but also economically useful, and it helps
to mitigate the UHI impact. While all of these green infrastructures and materials have
helped with UHI reduction and mitigation measures, there are several obstacles to their
widespread use in tall buildings that must be overcome. A lack of government regulation,
poor technology, an overestimation of economic benefits, and individual hesitation are all
factors holding progress back. Sustainable built environments in dense urban settings will
pave the way for environmental friendliness, a lesser UHI effect, and comfort for occupants
and other living beings and integrated ecosystems in the future by fixing the problems and
making it accessible to anyone, anywhere in the globe.
7. Conclusions
This article compares and analyzes many cutting-edge strategies for decreasing the
negative impacts of UHIs. The use of green roofing systems, green façades, and green
parking, pavement, and streets in place of traditional nature enhances the amount of green
space, aids in the implementation of heat reduction measures, and lessens the impact on
the environment through the cooling effect of metabolic processes. Green walls provide a
viable alternative and a large canvas on which to grow vegetation vertically. Sustainable
greenery mitigation measures will be bolstered by the replacement of roads and pavements
for walkers in highly urbanized areas with green installations. To further minimize solar
radiation absorption and boost surface heat, shading arrangements and coating materials
with specialized functions like white coloring, PCMs, color changes, and fluorescence need
to be implemented.
The adoption of energy-efficient appliances is an important step in mitigating the
effects of global warming caused by the production of GHGs and limiting the rise in global
surface temperature. The buildings, parks, water features, roadways, and recreational
spaces that make up urban areas will vary from one location to the other. Depending
on the type of building (such as residential, hotel, industrial, office, and retail complex
buildings), many greening initiatives and methods may be viable to execute. This study’sSustainability 2023, 15, 10767 20 of 26
main limitation is that it only took into account typical buildings and their accompanying
subcomponents like parking lots, pavements, and roadways. Hence, there are numerous
challenges that must be overcome before this idea can be used on a global scale, but doing
so will help to move closer to an environment where UHIs have less of an impact and,
hopefully, eventually have no effect at all. This is true on a local as well as global scale, and
it may be achieved via the implementation of efficient laws and regulations, the discovery
of new methods for handling existing problems, and the sharing of the findings of relevant
research and development initiatives.
The key findings from this review are listed below:
• The rapidly urbanizing cities around the world necessitate ecologically mindful and
sustainable ways to build.
• The UHI effect is a critical urban phenomenon; however, adequate mitigation efforts will
lessen the effects on the environment as well as on the safety and health of inhabitants.
• Infrastructure and building materials as well as greening the built environment are
crucial in managing UHIs.
• New and existing buildings should include infrastructure with green roofs, walls,
façades, green parking, water retaining pavements, and shaded roadways, which have
proven benefits toward mitigating UHIs.
• The incorporation of sustainable and environmentally friendly materials into the built
environment, such as innovative street and pavement systems, a variety of coating
materials, and the use of energy-efficient appliances, has provided a number of benefits
and been proven to be highly effective in lowering the UHI effect.

Abstract: Rapid Urbanization, and other anthropogenic activities, have amplified the change in
land-use transition from green space to heat emission in built-up areas globally. As a result, there
has been an increase in the land surface temperature (LST) causing the Urban Heat Island (UHI)
effect, particularly in large cities. The UHI effect poses a serious risk to human health and well-being,
magnified in large developing cities with limited resources to cope with such issues. This study
focuses on understanding the UHI effect in Kathmandu Valley (KV), Delhi, and Dhaka, three growing
cities in South Asia. The UHI effect was evaluated by analyzing the UHI intensity of the city with
respect to the surroundings. We found that the central urban area, of all three cities, experienced more
heat zones compared to the peri-urban areas. The estimated average surface temperature ranged
from 21.1 ◦C in March 2014 to 32.0 ◦C in June 2015 in KV, while Delhi and Dhaka experienced surface
temperature variation from 29.7◦C in June 2017 to 40.2◦C in June 2019 and 23.6◦C in March 2017
to 33.2 ◦C in March 2014, respectively. Based on magnitude and variation of LST, highly built-up
central KV showed heat island characteristics. In both Delhi and Dhaka, the western regions showed
the UHI effect. Overall, this study finds that the UHI zones are more concentrated near the urban
business centers with high population density. The results suggest that most areas in these cities have
a rising LST trend and are on the verge of being UHI regions. Therefore, it is essential that further
detailed assessment is conducted to understand and abate the impact of the temperature variations.

1. Introduction
The frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, are ex-
pected to rise with an increase in air temperature [1]. Such events are exacerbated when
coupled with Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. UHI is the phenomenon where urban air
temperatures are higher than the surrounding rural areas [2]. Several factors, such as an
increase in anthropogenic heat flux’s emission [3], change in urban geometry, and pop-
ulation density [4], and change in land-use and land cover LULC [5], results in the UHI
phenomenon. With the rapid increase in urbanization, the green land cover is replaced by
impervious land surfaces, such as concrete buildings and bituminous roads [6,7]. Change in
land cover properties alters the thermal properties, surface radiation, and humidity of the
urban area [8], leading to the UHI effect. Evaluation of UHI in urbanized and populated
cities is crucial to analyze the change in surface albedo, emissivity, and evapotranspira-
tion [6]. The UHI phenomenon has been widely studied [9–11] since its first observation by
Earth 2021, 2, 86–110. https://doi.org/10.3390/earth2010006 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/earthEarth 2021, 2 87
Howard in London [12]. The rise in UHI has affected both the natural and human systems
by changing rainfall patterns [13], worsening air quality [14], increasing flood risk, and
decreasing water quality [15], among others. Thus, UHI’s quantification is essential to
inform the potential direct and indirect risks exerted by rising temperatures [16,17]. Fur-
ther, extreme heatwaves and the related heat stress could be evaluated by analyzing UHI
intensity [18].
While there is evidence in the literature of land surface temperature (LST) link with
the UHI, a thorough examination of UHI is required to attribute the surface temperature
changes to local climate and anthropogenic disturbances e.g., rapid urbanization. Satellite-
based indices, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized
Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), may provide critical information on relationships be-
tween annual surface temperature, LST and UHI. The association between LST, NDVI,
and NDBI can provide crucial information for urban land managers and planners [19].
There is evidence that changes in LULC pattern has increased the frequency and inten-
sity of surface urban heat island (SUHI) thereby impacting the quality of life [20]. Thus,
quantification of UHI and LST will also help assess the impact on human health and
environmental changes [21].
Globally, there is significant evidence for urbanization and LST rise [22–25]. LST is a
vital step for the quantification of the UHI effect [26]. Dissanayake et al. [27], using Landsat
data, reported that the impervious area at Kanda City, Sri Lanka increased from 2.3% (1996)
to 6.7% (2006) to 23.9% (2017). With such an increase in impervious areas and changing
climate [28], an increase in LST has a greater influence on UHI [29]. With the advancement
in remote sensing techniques, the concept of SUHI has been used for the quantification of
UHI. SUHI relies on measuring the surface temperature through remote sensing imageries.
Limitations and shortcomings of the ground-based meteorological observations, such as
sparse gauge network and limited data availability, justifies the application of remote
sensing techniques. Liu et al. [30] reported that the SUHI, defined as an UHI quantified
by the difference in LST [31,32], was found to be more prevalent from May to October in
Beijing. They further stressed that SUHI intensity was more pronounced during July and
August. Another study across 419 global big cities, Peng et al. [33] showed that the average
annual daytime SUHI intensity was higher than that in the annual nighttime. Vegetation
clearance during urbanization has also been shown to cause an increase in LST and has
induced UHI effect. The surface temperature analysis showed that the minimum and
maximum temperatures at Skopje, Macedonia were 15◦C and 37 ◦C for 2013, and 24◦C
and 49 ◦C for 2017 [34]. Population density also has been shown to affect UHI. The spatial
variability of UHI showed higher intensity in densely populated areas compared to less
dense and peripheral urban areas at Sargoda City in Pakistan [35].
The spatial and temporal characteristics of LST, NDVI, and NDBI and their relationship
has been quantified at the global and regional scale. However, these association differ
between cities due to their unique geophysical, climate, and urban growth characteristics.
Research has been carried out in understanding the local climate of some cities in India,
however, no such study has been done for countries like Nepal. Understanding of the
urban climate behavior using the satellite images in major populated and urbanized cities
of South Asia is still lacking. This study aims to evaluate LST, NDVI, and NDBI and
explore their associations to fill the gap and advance our understanding for the region.
We have chosen three capital cities with growing populations-Kathmandu Valley (KV),
Delhi, and Dhaka-to represent the region. However, such quantification of LST and
SUHI (hereafter referred to as UHI) should help in planning other smart resilient cities in
the region.Earth 2021, 2 88
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials
2.1.1. Landsat–8 Data
We used Landsat 8 satellite images, OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal
Infrared Sensor) 15 to 30-m multispectral data from Landsat–8 C1 Level-1, downloaded
from United States Geological Survey (USGS). Thermal band, Band 10, is provided as
the atmospheric brightness temperature in Kelvin (K), and the multispectral-bands of
Landsat–8 OLI is provided as surface reflectance. Band 10 is available at 100m horizontal
resolution. Since the UHI effect is weakened by cloud cover [36], the satellite imagery with
cloud coverage <10% were selected (cloud-free). Cloud cover in the entire study area is not
similar. Data was selected to maintain temporal uniformity over the study period (Table 1).
This data selection should not be hindered as our study focused on LST variations and
UHI over modified land use rather than the absolute value of LST. A comprehensive
outline of the necessary metadata is outlined in Table 1. Data required were downloaded
from Earth Explorer [37] and masked to the study area. Then, the LST map for each study
area was generated for different data acquisition dates as shown in Table 1. The extracted
images for most of the years were obtained for summer (March-August) so that the high
surface temperatures could be captured. Since we filtered the cloud cover to be less than
10%, the downloaded satellite image could not coincide for the same day in each year and
most of the images were acquired for March. The scaling-factors used for determining LST
and UHI were extracted from metadata (K1 = 774.4483, K2 = 1321.0789, ML = 0.0003342,
AL = 0.1, please refer to Section 2.3.1 for details).

2.1.2. Population Distribution
The annual population distribution in the KV, Delhi and Dhaka is shown in Table 2 [38].
The increase in average rates of the population for KV, Delhi and Dhaka were found to
be 3.97%, 3.25%, and 3.61% respectively, the highest being in KV. The rate of population
change increased until 2014, then decreased until 2017, and again increased in the year
2018 for KV whilst remained constant throughout the study period for Delhi and Dhaka
except in the year 2019. The rate of population change is expected to drop to 3.49% for
KV, 3.03% for Delhi and 3.56% for Dhaka in the year 2020. Table 2 shows the increasing
population trend for all study areas which could eventually impact the land use pattern
and the surface temperature. The rapid increase in the urban population in two decades
has led to the rise in the rate of urbanization too in these cities.Earth 2021, 2 89

The average observed air temperature acquired [39] for all the study areas is shown
in Table 3. The observed temperature for the missing satellite data acquisition months
in 2015 and 2018 for Delhi were obtained on 28 July 2015 and 20 June 2018 respectively.
Likewise, the observed air temperature for Dhaka in 2013 was obtained on the day of 20
March 2013. Meanwhile, the missing temperature data on the satellite data acquisition day
were obtained by averaging the temperature from the previous day and the following day
of the missing date.

2.2. Study Area
South Asian (SA) nations, namely: Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, Maldives,
Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh combined have more than 18 billion population [40]
where 31% resides in the urban area [41]. The capitals of SA nations are economically rich,
urbanized, and highly populated. Delhi (30.2 million) and Dhaka (21.0 million) are the
top 10 most populated capital cities in SA, while KV is the most populated and emerging
urbanized city in Nepal. The rising population has induced urbanization in all these
capitals. The rate of urbanization is increasing rapidly with the increase in population to
130 million in just a span of 10 years (2001 to 2011) and is expected to reach 250 million
by 2025 [42] in SA. A brief description of each study area is discussed below under each
sub-sections. The section deals with the physiography and climate of each study area.
2.2.1. Kathmandu Valley
KV is one of the biggest cities, in terms of population and economic development,
in Nepal comprising an area of approximately 664 km2 (Figure 1). The bowl-shaped
valley is located at 85◦11′E 27◦32′N inscribing the major cities Kathmandu, Lalitpur and
Bhaktapur [43,44]. KV lies in the warm temperate zone [45] with a fair climate varying from
2.4 ◦C to 37 ◦C in the period of 1981–2010 [46]. Geographically, the central lower part of the
valley is situated at an elevation of 1425 m above mean sea level MSL and is surroundedEarth 2021, 2 90
by four mountain ranges namely Shivapuri, Phulchowki, Nagarjun, and Chandragiri Hills.
KV is the most developed city in Nepal with a greater portion occupied by the built-up
area. On the contrary, KV has some open spaces namely Tundikhel, Tribhuvan park,
Sankha park, etc., which are expected to serve as green space thereby reducing the rising
daytime temperature.

2.2.2. Delhi
Delhi located in Northern India, at 77◦14′E 28◦36′N is bordered by Uttar Pradesh
in the East and by the states of Haryana on the West, North and South (Figure 1). It
covers an area of 1484 km2, of which 783 km2 is designated as rural, and 700 km2 as urban
therefore making it the largest city in terms of area in India. It has a length of 51.9 km and
a width of 48.48 km. Delhi has a dry subtropical and semi-arid type of climate [47]. The
annual average temperature is 25◦C with monthly means varying from 13◦C to 32 ◦C.
The warm season begins in early April and peaks in late May or early June with an average
temperature of about 38◦C but occasional heat waves may result in high temperatures of
over 45 ◦C on some days. Per capita availability of green space in Delhi is about 20 m2
whereas that of open space is 30 m2 [48].
2.2.3. Dhaka
Dhaka is located in central Bangladesh at 90◦22′E 23◦42′N (Figure 1) along the eastern
banks of the Buriganga River. The city lies on the lower reaches of the Ganges Delta and
covers a total area of 306.38 km2. Dhaka has a tropical savanna climate. The city has a dis-
tinct monsoonal season, with an annual average temperature of 26◦C and monthly means
varying between 19◦C in January and 29◦C in May [49]. There are many parks within
Dhaka city, including Ramna Park, Suhrawardy Udyan, Shishu Park, National Botanical
Garden, Baldha Garden, Chandrima Uddan, Gulshan Park, and Dhaka Zoo. There are
lakes within the city, such as Crescent lake, Dhanmondi lake, Baridhara-Gulshan lake,
Banani lake, Uttara lake, and Hatirjheel-Begunbari lake. These parks and lakes act as green
space and help in minimizing the rising surface temperature.
2.3. Methodology
Figure 2 shows the flowchart of methodologies adopted in this study. A step-wise
description is discussed below:
2.3.1. Step-Wise Methodologies to Estimate UHI
Conversion of Spectral Radiance to Top of Atmospheric Brightness Temperature
Landsat 8 satellite imagery obtained was processed using 32-bit floating-point calcu-
lations. These values were then converted to 16-bit integer values in the finished level 1
product. Conversion to spectral radiance was done using the radiance scaling factors
provided in the metadata file [37] using Equation (1).
Lλ = ML ∗Qcal + AL (1)
The calculated spectral radiance was then converted to brightness temperature which
was often determined as the effective temperature under unit emissivity. Top of Atmo-
sphere (TOA) Brightness Temperature was obtained from spectral radiance in degree
Celsius using Equation (2).

OLI and TIRS band data were converted to radiance using the radiance scaling factors
provided in the metadata file using Equation (1) and then to TOA brightness temperature
using Equation (2). After acquiring brightness temperature, LST for Landsat–8 was esti-
mated using Equations (3)–(7). Parameters such as NDVI, proportion of vegetation (Pv),
and ground emissivity (e) were required to estimate the LST. Each parameters NDVI,
Pv and e were calculated using Equations (4), (6), and (7) respectively. NDVI was calcu-
lated using Near InfraRed Band (B5) and Red Band (B4) of Landsat imagery. Normalized
Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) was calculated using 6th (Middle InfraRed) and 5th
(Near InfraRed) of Landsat 8 bands using Equation (5).

3. Results
3.1. LST, NDVI, and NDBI for Each Study Area
3.1.1. Kathmandu Valley
The estimated spatial distribution of LST for KV is shown in Figures 3 and 4 for the
dates reported in Table 1. We observed an increase in surface temperature up to more
than 30 ◦C for 2015 and 2018. In the year 2015, LST was estimated for June so most
of the region in KV had higher temperature compared to other years. Kathmandu and
Lalitpur Metropolitan City (referred to as Kathmandu and Lalitpur) showed higher surface
temperature compared to other nearby municipalities (Madhyapur Thimi, Kirtipur etc.)
and rural municipalities (Konjyosom) (refer Figure 1 for the locations of administrative
units). It may be noted that in June 2015, Konjyosom rural municipality exhibited higher
temperature than in other years.
The peri-urban municipalities like Nagarjun, and the higher region of Budhanilkantha,
and Godawari had the temperatures ranging from 15◦C to 25 ◦C most of the years.
These regions also had surface temperature higher than 27◦C during 1 June 2015, 22 April
2018, and 8 May 2018. This might be due to the rise in air temperature as a result of
reflectance in the urban and barren land. Kathmandu and Lalitpur experienced higher
temperature most of the summer time. However, the boundaries of KV such as Chandragiri,
Dakshinkali, Nagarjun, Gokarneshwor, Budhanilkantha, and Konjyosom experienced
temperatures less than 10◦C.
The second and third columns of Figures 3 and 4 show the temporal and spatial distri-
bution of NDVI and NDBI for KV. The figures depicted that vegetative area (NDVI > 0)
was higher in the peri-urban area compared to central KV which had NDVI < 0, negative
NDVI for March 2013 and 2014. NDVI values for central KV were negative which support
the presence of non-vegetative areas usually barren land or built-up area. It was observed,
as expected, that the built-up area increased with the increase in population.Earth 2021, 2 94

Figure 4. LST, NDVI, NDBI estimated for Kathmandu Valley study area using Landsat–8 satellite imagery for the year
March 2017, April 2018 and March 2019.
Further, the result of NDBI confirmed that the built-up area (NDBI < 0) was con-
centrated in the central KV, mainly in Kathmandu, compared to peri-urban areas of KV
such as Godawari and Nagarjun municipalities. Central KV, including Kathmandu and
Lalitpur, had lower values of NDVI and higher values of NDBI which states that it KV
was less vegetative compared to other regions. NDVI ranged from−0.1 (March 2016) to
+0.6 (June 2015) during the study period in KV. Most of the peri-urban regions within
KV had higher values of NDVI during 2015 while central KV showed a lower value of
NDVI. Similarly, NDBI in KV ranged from−0.2 to +0.4. Most of the built-up areas were
concentrated in central KV while the peri-urban areas had lesser built-up areas as shown
in the third column of Figures 3 and 4. Expansion of NDBI further demonstrates that the
built-up areas in the eastern KV were increasing. Change in the land cover pattern such asEarth 2021, 2 96
the increase in impervious areas (attributed by increase in NDBI values) has limited the
recharge capacity of the groundwater in central KV [50,51] which eventually reduces the
soil moisture.
The estimated average surface temperature ranged from 20◦C in 2016 to 32 ◦C in 2015
(Table 4). The higher discrepancy in observed and estimated temperature occurred in the
year 2017 and 2019 resulting in higher differences of 5.04 and 5.3◦C, respectively. While
the discrepancies in other years were found to be comparatively less as shown in Table 4.

3.1.2. Delhi
Spatial and temporal distribution of LST, NDVI, and NDBI for Delhi is shown in
Figures 5 and 6. In the eastern end of Delhi two areas were not well characterized by the
satellite imagery, dark blue color on the right side for the year 2013–2016 and lower left
for the years 2017 and 2019. We did not consider and these two areas for the analysis. LST
for Delhi ranged from 15 to 30◦C in most of the regions during 2013–2017 while very few
areas experienced LST > 35 ◦C. However, the reverse was the case for the year 2019 where
most of Delhi received surface temperature > 35 ◦C, except for the Yamuna river ranging
from 25 to 30 ◦C. The comparison of observed and estimated LST Table 5 showed that the
maximum difference in the temperature was 9.3◦C in the year 2017, whereas the least bias
of 2.3 ◦C found in the year 2019.
LST in Delhi was found to be inconsistent intra-annually. During the year 2013, June
was considered for the evaluation purpose and the mean surface temperature was found to
be 32.8 ◦C with minimum and maximum LST being 14.7◦C and 42.9 ◦C, respectively. Areas
in the north of Delhi experienced the minimum temperature while the south-west region
exhibited the maximum temperature. Most of the regions in Delhi had LST ranging from 30
to 35 ◦C as shown in the upper panel under the LST column in Figure 5. However, in 2019,
mean LST was estimated to be 40.2 ◦C with minimum and maximum LST to be 29.8 and
47.7 ◦C respectively. The higher LST may be attributed to the increase in the built-up area,
also demonstrated by the NDBI. In contrast, the south-east part of Delhi shows reduction
in the LST values which may be an artifact of data processing. The maximum value of
NDBI in 2019 was found to be 0.51 which increased from 0.29 in 2013. Similarly, the result
of NDVI showed a decrease in the maximum vegetative index from 0.47 in 2013 to 0.44
in 2019.
The result of NDVI portrayed that vegetative area was less compared to non-vegetative
areas. The non-vegetative area increased with the increase in LST. The vegetative area
was more in south Delhi compared to north Delhi which holds more built-up towns and
industrial areas. However, in, 2016, NDVI map showed that Delhi has a more vegetative
area compared to non-vegetative which might be the result of lesser air temperature
(observed 33.5◦C) and higher relative humidity (RH) compared to 2015 and 2017 for the
same month. RH was found to be 21% in the data acquisition day in 2019.Earth 2021, 2 97

Similarly, 40◦C observed temperature and 30% RH, was observed in 2013. NDVI
values ranged from−0.09 in 2013 to 0.52 in 2016 (August). This suggested that Delhi
has a lesser vegetative area compared to the non-vegetative area. A similar pattern was
observed from NDBI. Most regions in Delhi have NDBI value ranging from−0.3 to 0.51,
the distribution shows higher percentage of the built-up area than the non-built-up area.
The NDBI values suggest that more areas in Delhi radiate the incoming sunlight thereby
increasing the temperature of the study area.
3.1.3. Dhaka
The spatial and temporal distribution of LST, NDVI, and NDBI were plotted for Dhaka
district as shown in Figures 7 and 8. The spatial distribution of LST over Dhaka showed
the temperature distribution in March 2014 was higher than 35◦C, a few areas have a
temperature less than 35◦C. This was validated by the observed temperature as shownEarth 2021, 2 98
in Table 6. The bias in observed air temperature and estimated surface temperature was
found to be−1.23 ◦C in the year 2014. The maximum bias of +5.5◦C was found in 2018.
The spatial distribution of NDVI showed that most of the western districts in Dhaka
such as Dhamari, Savar, Nawabgang and Dohar are vegetative compared to eastern districts
such as Tejgaon and Keraniganj. It further showed that during the years 2016 and 2017,
the non-vegetative area has increased in the eastern districts. The similar pattern was
observed from the NDBI too. The eastern districts are highly built-up in comparison with
the western. The NDBI values ranged from−0.10 in the year 2019 to +0.55 in the year 2018.
Negative values of NDBI showed a non-built-up region while the positive value reflected
the built-up area of the study area.

3.2. Relationship between LST, NDVI and NDBI
The relationship between LST, NDVI and NDBI is necessary to understand the UHI
phenomenon in urban cities. Increase in the LST values is governed by the climatic (rainfall,
air temperature, humidity) and non-climatic (land use and land cover, aerosols, air particles
in the atmosphere, built-up area) variables. Spatial average values of LST, NDVI, and NDBI
were used to understand the relationship between them.
3.2.1. Kathmandu Valley
The relationship between LST and NDVI showed a mixed relation trend for KV.
The negative linear trend exists for temperature less than 25◦C and the parabolic relation-
ship for higher values with p-value = 0.08 (p-value > 0.05) and R2 = 0.05. The statistical
performance of p-value shows that there is no statistically significant relation between
mean LST and mean NDVI. The non-vegetative area increased with increment in the sur-
face temperature (Figure 9). This implies that likely the increase in non-vegetative areas isEarth 2021, 2 101
directly associated with the change in surface temperature and built-up area [26]. For the
surface temperature ranging from 22.5◦C to 30.0 ◦C, the NDVI increased. This indicates
an increase in greenness together with an increase in surface temperature. This variation
might be attributed to rainfall days before the measurement was taken.
Figure 9. Relationship between LST and NDVI at different administrative units of Kathmandu Valley
(KV) region in 2013–2019.
3.2.2. Delhi
The relationship between mean LST and mean NDVI was established for the study
period 2013–2019 as shown in Figure 10. The statistical performance of the relationship
among mean LST and mean NDVI shows a negative linear trend with R2 value of 0.79 and
p-value = 0.043 (p-value < 0.05). This shows a statistically significant relationship between
mean LST and mean NDVI. Since Delhi is often viewed as a single administrative unit, we
have used only 5 temporal data points to develop the relationship. The Figure 10 shows
the well-distributed relationship between mean LST and NDVI (R2 = 0.79). The increase
in mean LST was concomitant in the decrease in vegetative area for Delhi. Thus with
the increase in the surface temperature, the number of UHI regions are likely to increase.
This situation might exacerbate the risk of heat-stroke in Delhi.
Figure 10. Relationship between LST and NDVI at Delhi in 2013–2019.
3.2.3. Dhaka
Relationships between mean LST and mean NDVI were studied for Dhaka district
and found that NDVI value increased slightly with the increase in LST. The statistical
result shows very low correlation exists between mean LST and mean NDVI (R2 ∼0).
The p-value is equal to 0.75 (p > 0.05) is not statistically significant and cannot provideEarth 2021, 2 102
enough evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis of similarity. During data acquisition
day in 2014–2019, most of the administrative units had mean LST ranging from 24.0◦C to
28.0 ◦C with the variation of NDVI ranging from 0.0 to 0.35 (Figure 11).
Figure 11. Relationship between LST and NDVI at different administrative units of Dhaka during
data acquisition day in the year 2014–2019.
3.3. UHI for the Study Area
UHI was calculated based on mean and standard deviation (SD) of LST. Green color
shows the non-UHIs while red color shows the UHI regions for each of the study areas.
The threshold value of UHI ranged from 21.6◦C to 24.2 ◦C for KV, from 26.2◦C to 41.3 ◦C
for Delhi and from 24.6 ◦C to 34.9 ◦C for Dhaka (Figures 12–14 respectively). The variation
in the UHIs was governed by the LST each land cover type had in the study area. Further,
the availability of green space (as seen from NDVI) and clustering of the built-up area (as
seen from NDBI) have a significant impact on the UHI for each study area.
3.3.1. Kathmandu Valley
The spatial and temporal distribution of UHI for the KV was developed for each
year using the surface temperature for the same month (Figure 12). Distribution of UHI
showed that for all the years, central KV experienced higher temperature and thus may
be considered as heat islands which were further supported by LST, NDVI and NDBI in
earlier sections. Compared to southern regions, the Northern region is highly populated
(as can be seen from NDBI maps) and thus these regions experienced higher temperatures.
On 26 March 2013, the central and Northern region experienced temperatures higher than
28.3 ◦C. The boundary administrative such as Budhanilkantha, Gorkarneshwor, Changu-
narayan, Godavari, Chandragiri, etc. had comparatively lesser UHI effects throughout the
study period. The result of UHI analysis also show an increasing trend in UHI especially in
the peri-urban areas. Spatial analysis revealed that the UHI zones were more concentrated
in the central and northern regions of the KV. UHI at the different administrative units of
KV reflected the increasing trend of UHI zones which might be the impact of increasing
population and intensified urbanization. Developing the new greener space might help in
reducing the impact of increasing UHI in the densely populated urban cities like KV [52].Earth 2021, 2 103

2013–2019. Green color shows the non-UHI zones and red color shows the UHI zones.
3.3.2. Delhi
Figure 13 showed the spatio-temporal distribution of UHI for Delhi. The minimum
threshold of UHI for Delhi was found to be 26.2 ◦C in the year 2016 on the data acquisition
date. The maximum threshold of UHI was estimated to be 41.3 ◦C for the year 2019.
With the higher values of mean LST and the least value of SD, most of the areas in Delhi
are estimated to behave non-UHI. Since the UHI threshold is less and the temperature
range is small, more UHI areas were observed in Delhi in 2016 compared to other high
UHI threshold years. This point to a limitation of UHI threshold for cities like Delhi.
Residential or mixed regions have a higher potential risk of UHI in Delhi as portrayed
by Mohan et al. [53]. Researchers [53] further stressed that UHI in summer is expected to
increase and become more dominant in the densely urbanized built-up areas.
3.3.3. Dhaka
The minimum and maximum threshold of UHI for Dhaka were found to be 24.6 ◦C
and 34.9 ◦C respectively (Figure 14). The result showed that western districts such as Dohar,
Nawabganj, Dhamrai behave as non-UHI while the eastern districts such as Tejgaon, Savar,
and Kernaiganj behave as UHI zones. The North-West region of Dhaka was less impacted
by the rising surface temperature and is thus identified as non-UHI regions throughout
the temporal study period. Eastern parts of Tejgaon and Keraniganj were identified as
UHI regions for each year is associated with a higher density of impervious structures
such as concrete buildings and paved roads in the region. The potential impact of UHI
is increased by the rising surface temperature in the Dhaka city from 28.5◦C in 2002 to
40.1 ◦C in 2014 [54].Earth 2021, 2 104

4. Discussions
Satellite imageries provide an appropriate platform to evaluate LST and UHI at any
spatial and temporal scale. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the UHIs
in densely populated cities of South Asia namely, Kathmandu, Delhi, and Dhaka using
satellite imageries. Also, we examined the LST, NDVI, and NDBI for the same to observe
the state of surface temperature, wetness, and dryness of the land and Built-up intensity
for the temporal period of 2013–2019.
4.1. Relationship between LST, NDVI and NDBI
Visual analysis of the LST showed that June 2015 was the most hottest month during
the temporal study period in KV. In 2014 and 2016, the month of March was found to have
less warm days in the high elevated regions where the LST is <10◦C (Figures 3 and 4).
In the case of Delhi, high LST was observed in 2019 followed by 2013 and 2014. Simi-
lar trends of the LST variation were observed in Dhaka. NDVI values for KV and Dhaka
were found to increase at the rate of 0.007 and 0.004 respectively while a negative trend
was observed in Delhi (Figure 15). The negative trend in Delhi might be the result of the
presence of a relatively higher amount of the open spaces as compared to KV and Dhaka.
The results depict an increasing trend of NDBI values for Delhi; almost no trend for Dhaka
and decreasing trend for KV (Figure 15). The spatio-temporal variation in the NDVI and
NDBI values might be the consequences of the local climatic conditions [55] of the study
area. The spatio-temporal variation over the different topographical regions has been well
established in the study domains. Climates of the study area have an important role in
governing LST, NDVI, NDBI, and UHI as computed in this study. The large orographic
differences over a short latitude change could be responsible for lesser LST and higher
NDVI values in the KV [45,56,57]. The differences in spatio-temporal LST retrieval in the
study domain might have been affected by the biophysical effects, evapotranspiration,
and albedo that are eventually influenced by precipitation and local climate [58]. Densely
populated zones in the study areas are found to have higher LST values compared to
surrounding areas. The higher values of LST in the central zone of the study area is likely
due to the densely built-up area and paved roads [26,59]. Pan et al. [60] found that
the LST values at built-up areas are higher than 40◦C in the humid subtropical climate.
The variation in LST was also attenuated by the change in elevation. Increase in the LST
values was also concomitant with increased population in all the cities of South Asia [61].

4.2. Quantification of UHI from Retrieved LST
UHI values retrieved for the study areas showed the increment in UHI zones with
the passage of time. In KV, the lower UHI values ranged from 21.6◦C in 2016 to 24.2 ◦C
in 2019 while the maximum reached 40 ◦C. The lower UHI values for Delhi varied fromEarth 2021, 2 106
26.2 ◦C in 2016 to 41.3 ◦C in 2019. Similarly, the lower UHI values for Dhaka varied
from 24.6 ◦C in 2017 to 34.9 ◦C in 2014. The business centers attributed by economic
conditions [62] and increased population [63] in each study area were found to have higher
UHI values compared to surrounding areas. The increased built-up areas and the paved
roads might be the driving factors that alter the spatio-temporal alteration of UHI zones.
Further, the reduced open spaces (green areas) and current development works such as
the construction of roads, buildings might have aggravated the increase in the UHI zones.
Growth and development activities increases the impervious surfaces, resulting in reduced
evapotranspiration and lesser soil moisture [64], which ultimately have a direct impact
on the LST of the urban areas. The spatio-temporal variation in UHI values across the
study area has been impacted by increased NDBI index [34]. UHI magnitudes increased
across the regions with increased NDBI and decreased NDVI. El Niño might also have
contributed to the wider variability of UHI effects in the study regions [65].
4.3. Impact of UHIs and Mitigation Strategies to Minimize Rising Surface Temperature
The UHIs has diverse impacts on different elements of the society such as energy
consumption, human health, biodiversity, agriculture, water availability and others [66].
With the increase in the urban population (Table 2) and urbanization, the intensity and
frequency of the heatwaves have increased. Further, an increase in the frequency and
magnitude of hotter days attributed by the rise in LST and UHI zones have a direct impact
on the energy consumption. The urban population tends to consume more electricity to
make themselves more comfortable against the increasing heat. In recent years, the trend
of electricity consumption in SA region is increasing [67,68]. The increase in electricity
consumption might be the cumulative impact of the increasing population, rising urban-
ization, growing wealth, and climate extremities. Further, the increased climate extremes
(such as heat strokes, UHI, increased LST) has also impacted the health of the people in SA.
The comfort level induced by the climatic extremes in the health of the residents of any city
is measured in terms of discomfort index (DI) and physiological equivalent temperature
(PET) index. The previous research in SA and West Bengal (India) showed that the area with
shades due to high rise buildings and trees have comfortable conditions compared to the
one with no shades [66,69]. The increase in surface temperature has increased the number
of heat strokes in urban cities of SA [70]. The number of patients suffering from heat stroke
was found to be comparatively higher in the urban centers than in the peri-urban areas of
SA. This supports the idea that increasing UHI and LST has increased the risk of heatwave
globally and regionally [71,72]. The increased surface temperature has a significant impact
on diarrheal disease and heat stress in Bangladesh [73]. The policy makers and planners of
each study region now need to focus on the proper mitigation and adaptation strategies to
cope against the rising LST and increasing UHIs. This study shows that more planning and
perhaps enforcement are required to reduce the impact of the rising surface temperature.
Increase in the green land area and afforestation activities can reduce the impact of excess
heating from the solar radiation. This also enhances the asthetics of the city. Few mitigation
strategies have been considered by the local government in Kathmandu valley such as
cleaning of the Bagmati river corridor and increasing the number of new recreational parks.
In India, Niti Aayog has proposed to ban the diesel vehicle and sell the electric vehicle
by 2030 to reduce the air pollution. Such major mitigation measures are necessary for
reduction of UHI too for the region to be better prepared for climate extremities.
4.4. Limitations of the Research
The current study has limitations in the spatial and temporal domains. Temporally,
we only focused on the summer days to assess the summer surface temperature and
subsequent heat island. Spatially we focused on the highly urbanized and rapidly rising
cities at SA. The study focused on three major cities, however several smaller cities in SA
may face similar problems. A coordinated effort is needed to understand the regional LSTEarth 2021, 2 107
and UHI in detail. Also, understanding of antecedent conditions coupled with on ground
sensing may be beneficial for future work.
5. Conclusions
This study evaluated the UHI using the Landsat-8 satellite images in three densely
populated cities of South Asia namely, Kathmandu Valley, Delhi, and Dhaka. These are
the growing cities in terms of economic development, urbanization and population rise.
The spatial and temporal variations of LST, NDVI, NDBI, and UHI were analyzed in these
three cities to assess the impact of urbanization on the surface temperatures. An increase in
the impervious areas, such as concrete buildings and paved roads reduces the recharge
capacity of the soils thereby reducing the soil moisture. This leads to an increase in barren
and non-vegetative lands in these urban cities. The analysis of LST and UHI in these
urban cities demonstrate the importance of urban planning to mitigate the effects of future
climate. The analysis was focused from 2013–2019 when the cloud cover is less than 10%.
The following conclusions are drawn from the research:
1. Results of LST showed the surface temperature is more in the Kathmandu and
Lalitpur Metropolitan City while the regions that are situated at the boundaries
of KV experienced LST less than 10◦C, below that of KV. Similarly, for Delhi higher
LST is observed in the western region of Delhi and the eastern region of Dhaka. It can
be inferred that the zones which are densely populated experience higher LST.
2. Like LST, NDVI of the study area shows more vegetative regions in peri-urban areas
and less in the central KV. NDVI result of Delhi shows a lesser vegetative area than
the non-vegetative area. In the case of Dhaka, the eastern district (Tejgaon) has less
vegetative area compared to the western region.
3. NDBI shows the concentration of built-up areas in most regions of the KV (NDBI > 0).
Regions with NDBI < 0 are concentrated in the peripheries of KV. Similarly, NDBI re-
sult exhibits that the built-up area is concentrated in the western region for Delhi and
the eastern region for Dhaka.
4. The results of this study imply that the spatial distribution of LST magnitude and
UHI zones are greater in Delhi and Dhaka compared to KV. However, the core center
of the KV has a higher rate of LST magnitude and UHI effects are increasing faster
annually.
5. The results of the research provide insights into urban microclimates and changes in
the environment that may be used for drafting the city planning legislation to mitigate
the rising LST.

Abstract
At present, understanding the synergies between the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) phenomenon and extreme climatic
events entailing high mortality, i.e., heat waves, is a great challenge that must be faced to improve the quality of life in urban
zones. The implementation of new mitigation and resilience measures in cities would serve to lessen the effects of heat waves
and the economic cost they entail. In this research, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the SUHI were determined
through Sentinel-3A and 3B images of the eight capitals of Andalusia (southern Spain) during the months of July and August
of years 2019 and 2020. The objective was to determine possible synergies or interaction between the LST and SUHI, as
well as between SUHI and heat waves, in a region classified as highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. For each
Andalusian city, the atmospheric variables of ambient temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and direction were obtained
from stations of the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET); the data were quantified and classified both in periods
of normal environmental conditions and during heat waves. By means of Data Panel statistical analysis, the multivariate
relationships were derived, determining which ones statistically influence the SUHI during heat wave periods. The results
indicate that the LST and the mean SUHI obtained are statistically interacted and intensify under heat wave conditions. The
greatest increases in daytime temperatures were seen for Sentinel-3A in cities by the coast (LST
=
3.90 °C, SUHI
=
1.44 °C)
and for Sentinel-3B in cities located inland (LST
=
2.85 °C, SUHI
=
0.52 °C). The existence of statistically significant posi-
tive relationships above 99% (p < 0.000) between the SUHI and solar radiation, and between the SUHI and the direction of
the wind, intensified in periods of heat wave, could be verified. An increase in the urban area affected by the SUHI under
heat wave conditions is reported.

1 Introduction
In recent decades, numerous studies warn that the transfor-
mation of the landscape owing to the expansion of urban
areas is one of the processes that contributes most to climate
change (Li et al. 2011; Carvalho et al. 2017; Jiang et al.
2019; Yang et al. 2019; Song et al. 2020). Changes in land
cover increase the surfaces of impermeable materials, such
as asphalt and concrete, reducing evapotranspiration (Stew-
art and Oke 2012). These materials are known to store the
heat coming from solar radiation and subsequently release
it into the atmosphere (Arnfield 2003; Zhou et al. 2015; An
et al. 2020).
The greatest increases in temperature occur in cities,
mainly due to a phenomenon of urban climate altera-
tion (Li et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2016;
Luo and Lau 2018; Zhao et al. 2018; Tewari et al. 2019;
Anjos et al. 2020) called Urban Heat Island (UHI), whose
intensity is heightened by multiple human activities (Lai
et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2020; Santamouris 2020) and by
extreme weather events such as droughts or heat waves.
The positive interaction between UHI and heat waves is
well documented: in Baltimore and Maryland (Li and
Bou-Zeid 2013), Beijing (Li et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2019),
New York (Ramamurthy and Bou-Zeid 2017), Shanghai
and Guangzhou (Jiang et al. 2019) and Athens (Founda
and Santamouris 2017).
Research shows that heat waves are becoming more
intense, lasting longer, and occurring more frequently
(Meehl and Tebaldi 2004; Sun et al. 2014). It is anticipated
that by the end of the twenty-first century they will affect
larger land areas (Meehl and Tebaldi 2004; Lau and Nath
2012; Coumou et al. 2013). Episodes of increased anthro-
pogenic heat are known to be among the natural phenom-
ena having the greatest social, economic and environmen-
tal impact (An et al. 2020). They imply more consumption
of electricity and water in homes (Valor et al. 2001), and
increased morbidity and mortality (Semenza et al. 1996;
Poumadère et al. 2005; Jiang et al. 2019; An et al. 2020).
Proof can be found in the heat wave of Chicago in 1995,
which caused 800 deaths (Semenza et al. 1996), that of
the summer of 2003 in Europe, when 70,000 people died
(Robine et al. 2008), the one occurring in Russia dur-
ing the summer of 2010 (Grumm 2011), that of eastern
China in 2013 (Xia et al. 2016), or Northwestern USA and
Western Canada (Lytton) in 2021, with temperatures over

45.0 °C on consecutive days and extremely warm nights in
between, causing some 500 deaths (UNO 2021).
While a positive interaction between SUHI and heat
waves has been demonstrated, the type of climate or particu-
lar climatic conditions (wind speed and direction, solar radi-
ation) and geomorphological factors of cities are contribute
substantially to this interaction (Zhao et al. 2014; Yoon et al.
2018; Jiang et al. 2019; An et al. 2020; Qiu et al. 2020; Ven-
ter et al. 2020). Studies of cities in Oklahoma (Basara et al.
2010), several European cities (Founda et al. 2015), London
(Gregor et al. 2007) or Beijing and Guangzhou (Jiang et al.
2019) report increases in SUHI that are stronger during the
night. In contrast, studies of Athens and Parma (House and
Santamouris 2011) and Shanghai (Ao et al. 2019; Jiang et al.
2019) found that the SUHI rise was stronger during the day.
Other studies found no significant amplification of the SUHI
(Ramamurthy and Bou-Zeid 2017; Scott et al. 2018; Zhao
et al. 2018).
Among the different methodologies used to determine
this phenomenon, thermal remote sensing stands out because
of its capacity to allow large-scale urban studies of LST
and SUHI using satellite images with Thermal Infrared
Sensor (TIRS) sensors. Studies involving these systems and
the dynamics of urban climate have become consolidated
as an important field of research (Ramamurthy and Bou-
Zeid 2017) with an extensive body of literature (Wang and
Ouyang 2017; Song et al. 2018; Yao et al. 2018; Sejati et al.
2019; Guo et al. 2020; Hu et al. 2020; Roy et al. 2020; Shafi-
zadeh et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020a). A relatively recent but
highly accurate product used in many studies is Sentinel-3
imaging. All Sentinels have 3 TIRS channels—bands 7, 8
and 9—that provide LST estimates at a resolution of 1000 m.
Their use for this type of research lends an important advan-
tage over satellites such as Landsat or NOAA, since they
orbit twice a day over the same point on the planet—once
during the day and again at night. The use of Sentinel-3
is widely documented in the literature, e.g., through SUHI
studies of the cities of Daman (India) and Huazhaizi (China)
(Yang et al. 2020b), Oklahoma City (USA) and Dahra (Sen-
egal) (Sobrino et al. 2016).
The space–time variability of the SUHI in cities under
Heat Wave conditions is largely unknown, and very few
studies have focused on cities in the Mediterranean Basin.
Recent estimates are that the mean air temperature will be
1–3 °C higher in the near future (compared to 1961–1990),
3–5 °C higher by the middle of the century (2040–2069)
and approximately 3.5–7 °C higher by the end of the century
(2070–2100) (Founda et al. 2015; Founda and Santamouris
2017); values for the Mediterranean Sea basin may be even
higher (Ward et al. 2016; Cramer et al. 2018).
The fact that temperature in the Mediterranean region is
increasing at a faster rate than elsewhere in the world leads it
to be considered an area of high vulnerability due to climate
change. Such potentially dire circumstances, together with
the variability of the data, accentuate the need for detailed
research efforts. In this case, a quantitative and systematic
study of the existence of synergies between SUHI and heat
waves in the cities of Andalusia (Spain) was undertaken.
This adverse meteorological phenomenon is a problem
that tends to affect urban populations in particular. The syn-
ergies between SUHI and heat waves may be questioned,
however, owing to disparate results reported to date, and
insufficient knowledge about the factors affecting their
intensity, properties, and activation flow. Such information
is crucial for the establishment of adequate mitigation or
resilience measures for urban planning in attempts to limit
the effects and economic cost of heat waves (Emmanuel and
Krüger 2012). This research aims to analyze the relationship
between heat wave and three outstanding factors: solar radia-
tion, wind speed and direction.
Our study was intended to characterize and quantify the
variability of the LST and the day and night SUHIs of all
eight Andalusian (southern Spain) capital cities using Sen-
tinel-3 images, throughout the months of July and August of
2019 and 2020, when five heat waves occurred. The factors
involved were statistically analyzed using the Data Panel
method. The methodology entailed an open source envi-
ronment allowing one to monitor SUHI the variations in
a precise, urgent and economic way, providing for a more
comprehensive understanding of the space–time variability
of the SUHI during Heat Wave periods, and of underlying
factors.
2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Study Area and Data Source
The area under study comprises the eight provincial capi-
tals of the region of Andalusia, located in southern Spain
(Fig. 1).
Four of them are inland cities: Sevilla, Cordoba, Granada
and Jaen. The other four are coastal cities: Huelva, Cadiz,
Málaga and Almería. Characteristics of the population, sur-
face area, climate, rainfall, altitude and UTM coordinates
are found in Table 1.
According to Spain´s National Institute of Statistics
(INE), Andalusia covers an area of 87,268 ­ km2 and has a
population of 8,427,325, being the second largest region
and the most populated one in all of Spain. The region
shows different local background climates. According
to the Koppen-Geiger climate classification, the cities
of Cadiz and Huelva share a Mediterranean Oceanic cli-
mate (Csb), the cities of Sevilla, Malaga, Cordoba and
Jaen feature a Mediterranean climate (Csa), and Granada

Climate Zones: Csa Mediterranean Climate, Csb Mediterranean Oceanic Climate, Bsk Cold Semi-Arid Climate
and Almería have a cold semi-arid climate (Bsk). Such
typologies imply mild, humid winters and hot, dry sum-
mers (De Castro et al. 2007). The region is bordered by
mountains to the north, while the Mediterranean Sea lies
to the south. This circumstance makes the sea and land
breezes strongly impact coastal cities. The average altitude
is 503 m above sea level; the annual average temperature
fluctuates between 11 °C in January and 26.5 °C in July,
with minima in winter of − 3 °C and extremes in summer
of 44 °C. The approximate number of hours of sunshine
per year ranges between 2800 and 3200, giving an average
between 7.67 and 8.76 h of sunshine per day, depending
on the area within the Andalusian region.
2.2 Methodology
The methodology carried out in this research called for
obtaining the LST using Sentinel-3 images and validating
them by comparison with the ambient temperatures recorded
by AEMET (Srivastava et al. 2009; Gallo et al. 2011; Li et al.
2013; Avdan and Jovanovska 2016; Rongali et al. 2018). They
were classified in periods of normal environmental conditions
and in periods under heat wave. Next, the LST and SUHI
values were obtained for statistical analysis, as seen in Fig. 2.
The Data Panel statistical method was used for data
analysis. Unlike more traditional methods of analysis, it
admits a greater number of data, including the individual

effects of each city in the overall result, while eliminat-
ing the problem of collinearity between variables. Using
this method allowed us to reflect possible variations in the
conditions of each city contemplated in the final results,
which makes it a unique and powerful approach. It has
been validated by studies (Chen et al. 2011; Alcock et al.
2015; Fang and Tian 2020) similar to ours, accounting for
time series of multiple cities or areas, as well as quantita-
tive variables when the conditions may vary among the
cities analyzed.
2.3 Identification of Heat Waves
According to the AEMET, during 2019 three episodes clas-
sified as heat waves in Andalusia, and in 2020 just two.
Table 2 indicates their onset, end date and duration, along
with the thermal anomaly they produced in room temper-
ature and the maximum temperature reached. Although
numerous studies cite decreased environmental pollution,
LST and SUHI as a consequence of the lockdown situa-
tion caused by COVID-19 (Ali et al. 2021; Das et al. 2021;

Nakajima et al. 2021; Pani et al. 2020; Srivastava et al. 2021;
Toro et al. 2021), no scientific evidence stands to indicate a
decrease in heat waves due to or during this situation.
To facilitate comparison of the LST and SUHI of peri-
ods under heat wave conditions with periods of “normal”
environmental conditions, the 2 days before and after each
heat wave period were taken into account. In total, the envi-
ronmental parameters of the eight cities were studied for
20 days under normal conditions and 24 days under heat
wave conditions.
2.4 Sentinel‑3 Images. Land Surface Temperature
Estimation
Sentinel-3 satellites are equipped with the high-resolution
scanning instrument LST Radiometer, enabling LSTs of the
Earth's surface to be obtained. Its thermal products have
three levels of processing (levels 0, 1 and 2), although only
the last two are available for download. Those of level 1
present radiance and brightness temperatures that require
split window (SW) algorithms to obtain the LST. Level 2
products directly and automatically include the LST together
with associated parameters such as the Normalized Vegeta-
tion Index (NDVI), Vegetation Type (Biome), Vegetable
Fraction (Pv) and Normalized Difference Index (NDBI).
The existing SW algorithms that serve to gauge LST are
based on the concept of differential absorption (McMillin
1975), whereby the difference between the two TIRS band
wavelengths allows for correction of the atmospheric effects
produced on the signal. Abundant studies report on the vali-
dation, use and precision of these algorithms in Sentinel-3
images (Coppo et al. 2010; Wan 2013; Ruescas et al. 2016;
Sobrino et al. 2016; Prikaziuk and van der Tol 2019; Chiang
and Ivan 2020; Yang et al. 2020b).
The SW algorithm of the official Sentinel-3A and 3B
level 2 SLSTR product implicitly incorporates soil emis-
sivity by means of the following equation (Remedios and
Emsley 2012):
1
LST= af,i,pw + bf,i(T11− T12)
cos(𝜃
m ) + (bf,i + cf,i)T12− 273.15,
(1)
where LST is the surface temperature in degrees C; a, b and
c are coefficients dependent on the vegetation cover and the
biome; and ­ T11 and ­ T12 are the brightness temperatures of
bands 8 and 9 of Sentinel-3, respectively. θ is the zenith
angle of view of the satellite and m is a dependent variable
of θ (Remedios and Emsley 2012; Yang et al. 2020a).
Andalusia lies below the route of the Sentinel-3A and
3B satellites. The usual daytime hours of passage over the
region are between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m.; nighttime passage
is between 20:00 and 22:00 h (8:00–10:00 p.m.). The images
1 3 chosen for the study correspond to 44 days in the months of
July and August of 2019 and 2020. Throughout this time
interval, a total of 88 images were used, 44 corresponding
to Sentinel-3A (day) and 44 corresponding to Sentinel-3B
(night). All of them have a cloudiness index of less than 15%
to ensure accuracy in obtaining the LST and subsequently
calculate the SUHI. The images used were acquired through
the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Open Access
Hub for level 2.
After downloading the images, they were reclassified and
corrected using the Toolbox (S3TBX) under the Sentinel
Application Platform (SNAP) open-source software environ-
ment, version 7.0.0. With the help of SNAP 7.0.0 and using
level 2 products, the day and night LST of each investigated
day were recovered for each city. The LST images were sub-
sequently exported in Geotiff format to QGIS open-source
software, version 3.10.5.
2.5 Rural Stations and Meteorological Data
The ambient temperature was obtained from AEMET. This
national weather agency has multiple rural observation sta-
tions in Andalusia that hourly collect the environmental
parameters of the site where they are located. The ambient
temperature was needed to subsequently validate the satel-
lite data, as indicated in the methodology section. So as to
minimize the impact of the rural environment on calcula-
tion of the SUHI with Sentinel-3 images, the ones located
in rural areas—surrounded by farmland and with few
impervious surfaces—were selected for each city studied.
This selection criterion has given statistically significant
impacts in similar investigations (Wang et al. 2017; Jiang
et al. 2019).
The rural stations of reference were selected taking
into account the following considerations (Wang et al.
2017): (1) The % of impervious surfaces around the sta-
tion is roughly 10% and the proportion of farmland must
be greater than 65%; (2) the difference in surface eleva-
tion between the station and the city would be approxi-
mately 30 m; (3) rural stations had to be outside the
main urban areas; (4) An approximate area of 1000 ×
1000 ­ m2 of equal coverage should surround the station.
Given these prerequisites, a rural meteorological station
was chosen for each city, its characteristics and location
shown in Table 3.
Heat waves in Spain are often associated with strong
anticyclonic conditions and large-scale subsidence with
warm advection from North Africa in the lower atmosphere
(Xoplaki et al. 2003). For the days and hours selected in this
research, and from each rural meteorological station, the
following data were obtained: ambient temperature, solar
radiation, wind speed and direction.

Previous research (van Hove et al. 2015; Gaur et al. 2018;
Jiang et al. 2019) indicates that solar radiation and wind
speed and direction are elements that condition the inten-
sity of SUHI in cities. The high pressures associated with
heat waves decrease wind speed and cloud cover, which
causes the earth's surface to receive more solar radiation.
An increase in solar radiation produced by high pressure
and low cloud cover increases environmental temperatures.
Such circumstances reduce cooling and amplify the SUHI
phenomenon (Oke 1987; Ackerman and Knox 2012; Li and
Bou-Zeid 2013). Accordingly, certain studies (De Boeck
et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2019) report that
during heat wave periods, solar radiation may be 2.5 times
higher than under normal conditions, a fact related to SUHI
amplification in many cities.
2.6 Surface Urban Heat Island estimation
In the literature, UHI and SUHI are defined in terms of dif-
ferent temperatures measured within an urban area and in
rural areas surrounding the city, taken at the same time (Oke
1987). UHI refers to ambient temperatures and SUHI to ter-
restrial surface temperatures. Therefore, the SUHI can be
determined according to Eq. 2:
SUHI= LSTurban− LSTrural.
(2)
Having exported the LST images of Sentinel day and
night to QGIS software, version 3.10.5, and with the help
of the raster calculator command, the SUHI of the city was
determined by means of Eq. 2.
2.7 Analytical Strategy
Introducing the Data Panel method of statistical analysis in
the model entailed two phases (Chen et al. 2011). Firstly,
by means of the Hausman proof, the effects of analysis
were determined to be either fixed or random. Then the
model was assessed in view of the results obtained in
Wooldridge and Wald Tests. There are three options for
calculation: Method of Ordinary Squares (MOS), General-
ized Least Squares (GLS) and the Method of Intragroup
Estimators (MIE) (Labra 2014).
The first of the three, while widely used for years, does
not enable the effects of every individual to be analyzed
over the course of time, which can give rise to biased
estimators.
The second is considered to be a more efficient exten-
sion of the first. It is assumed that individual effects are
not reflected in the explanatory variables of the model;
instead, they contribute to the error term, following the
expression:
Yit = 𝛽Xit + (𝛼i + 𝜇it),
(3)
where 𝛼i represents the individual effects, 𝜇it is the error of
the model, X would represent explanatory variables, i
=
indi-
vidual and t
=
time.
The third method cited above assumes that individual
effects are in line with the explanatory variables, so that
the individual effect is separated after error, under the fol-
lowing calculation:
Yit = 𝛼i + 𝛽Xit + 𝜇it,
(4)
Published in partnership with CECCR at King Abdulaziz University

where, again, 𝛼i are the individual effects, 𝜇it is the error of
the model, X are explanatory variables, i
=
individual and
t
=
time.
3 Results
3.1 Land Surface Temperature by Sentinel day
and night versus Rural Weather Stations
Overall, the Sentinel day and night products present higher
mean values than those obtained from the AEMET rural
meteorological stations for the study periods in 2019 and
2020. The two temperatures are different but correlated,
meaning they will serve later to validate the LST data
obtained by satellite. Specifically, in the morning the high-
est mean LST values are obtained using the official product
Sentinel day (39.46 °C), while the mean environmental tem-
perature of the rural station was lower (35.87 °C). At night,
the highest mean LST values are obtained with the official
Sentinel product (24.05 °C), and the mean environmental
temperature of rural stations was again lower (21.10 °C).
The mean differences obtained between the LSTs with sat-
ellite images and the rural stations amounted to 3.59 °C for
Sentinel Day, and 2.95 °C for Sentinel night. Findings of
increased LST with Sentinel-3 images are reproduced for
both inland cities and coastal cities: the former show LST
differences of 3.70 °C with Sentinel day and 3.10 °C with
Sentinel night, while coastal cities show LST differences of
3.48 ºC with Sentinel day and 2.84 °C with Sentinel night.
3.2 LST Amplified Under Heat Waves
The statistics of the daytime and nighttime LST obtained by
means of the Sentinel day and night products for the inland
and coastal Andalusian cities during the period under study
are shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the daytime LSTs of
the inland cities are higher than the LSTs of the coastal cit-
ies, whether under normal environmental conditions or in
periods of heat wave. The nighttime LSTs of inland cities
are seen to be lower than those of coastal cities, both under
normal environmental conditions and during heat waves.

As can be seen in Table 4, during the mornings the
LST values of urban areas are lower than the values of
rural areas. Numerous academic studies (Saaroni et al.
2018; Wu et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2020a) indicate that
the reasons for the higher LST in rural areas is motivated
by the higher long wave radiation received by rural areas
compared to urban ones, owing to the shade generated
by buildings and trees and the cooling rates produced
in urban green areas. The increases in diurnal LST in
inland cities under heat wave conditions with respect
to the same areas in normal conditions were 1.93 °C
and 1.55 °C for urban and rural areas, respectively. In
contrast, the nocturnal temperature differences respec-
tively amounted to 3.15 °C and 2.54 °C. The diurnal
LST increase in coastal cities in heat wave conditions
with respect to the same areas in normal conditions
was 3.53 °C for urban and 4.26 °C for rural areas. The
nocturnal increases gave values of 1.13 °C and 1.02 °C,
respectively.
In view of the above results, it can be said that periods
of heat wave entail increases in the day and night LSTs
for both urban and rural areas, in the coastal as well as
the inland cities of Andalusia. Still, the increase is greater
during the morning in the coastal cities, and in the after-
noon in the inland cities (Table 4). During the morning, the
coastal cities present average values that are 3.90 °C higher
when compared to the periods of normal environmental
conditions; the increase in LST produced in the inland cit-
ies is, in contrast, only 1.74 °C. Contrariwise, at night, the
coastal cities present mean values 1.08 °C higher than the
values for periods of normal environmental conditions, as
opposed to the increase in LST produced in the inland cit-
ies of 2.85 °C.
3.3 SUHI Amplified Under Heat Waves
The statistics of the diurnal SUHI obtained with day and
night Sentinel products for the inland and coastal cities dur-
ing the study period are shown in Fig. 4.
As Table 5 shows, the cities of Andalusia present nega-
tive mean values for the diurnal SUHI that intensify in heat
wave conditions, most notably in coastal cities. Similarly,
the night SUHIs present positive mean values, intensified
under heat wave conditions. However, their intensification
is greater in inland cities than in coastal cities. The nega-
tive values indicate that during the morning, temperatures
in rural areas are higher than temperatures in urban areas,
producing the phenomenon known as urban cooling island
(Saaroni et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019). In
the early morning hours, solar radiation is greater in rural
areas because in the city, shade is generated by buildings,
trees, and the heterogeneous system of impermeable walls
with great thermal absorption and heat capacity. The sources
of shade in the city prevent long wave solar radiation from
heating the waterproof walls of urban areas and giving off

high doses of heat, altering the LST of the area (Li and
Meng 2018; Lemus et al. 2020; Logan et al. 2020; Yang
et al. 2020b). The areas where the rural stations are located
are farmlands with less than 10% of impervious surfaces and
a mean NDVI that ranges between 0.2 and 0.5.
Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the diurnal and nocturnal SUHI
values under heat wave conditions (blue line) and under nor-
mal environmental conditions (brown line). In general, the
blue lines are found above the brown lines, indicating that
the temperatures in heat wave periods are higher than the
values under normal conditions. These increases occur in
both inland and coastal cities. Yet the increases are greater
during the day in coastal cities, and at night in inland cities.
Figure 7 shows the mean SUHI during the period under
study obtained with Sentinel day for coastal cities under nor-
mal environmental conditions and under heat wave condi-
tions. The intensity and extension of the SUHI are seen to be
greater in the images obtained during the heat wave.
Figure 8 shows the mean SUHI during the period under
study obtained with Sentinel night for inland cities under
both normal environmental conditions and heat wave condi-
tions. Both the intensity and the extension of the SUHI are
greater in the images obtained during the heat wave.
3.4 Statistical Analysis
3.4.1 Satellite Temperature Validation
To validate the satellite data obtained, it is important to
obtain the linear adjustment coefficients R2, correlation coef-
ficient (CC), standard deviation (SD), the mean bias error
(MBE) and the root mean square error (RMSE), each indi-
cated in Table 6. The results of R2 are considered adequate
since they present values above 0.94. This circumstance
indicates good concordance between the values analyzed,
being above 94% and considered statistically significant.
Because these values denote a good agreement between
the environmental temperature values and the LST obtained
from the satellite, they lend validity to the results obtained.

Next, the statistical analysis of the variables that could
influence the SUHI obtained with Sentinel day and night
was carried out using the Data Panel method. The variables
were: solar radiation, wind speed, and wind direction. It was
first necessary to determine whether calculation should be
carried out using fixed or random effects. The Hausman test
was implemented to this end, its results marking the need to
use the panel of robust random effects for the data obtained
in the first and in the second phase of analysis. To develop
the Data Panel, the Generalized Least Method (GLM) was
used, with Eq. 3.
3.4.2 Interaction between SUHI and LST
The results of the statistical analysis of the LST and SUHI
data obtained by Sentinel day and night in the study periods
are given in Table 7.
The results of the statistical analysis of the SUHI data
obtained through Sentinel day and night images point
to a statistically significant relationship of 95% with the
independent variable LST. The values obtained for R2
and the F statistic of the SUHI data are shown in Table 8.
The data show good agreement between the dependent
and independent variables according to the method used,
with a level of adjustment lower than 90% significance, as
Prob > chi2
> 0.000.
3.5 Solar Radiation Contributions to the SUHI
The AEMET has certified points for the measurement of
direct and diffuse solar radiation at rural meteorologi-
cal stations. Direct solar radiation is obtained by means
of a Kipp-Zonen Pyrheliometer, while for diffuse solar
radiation a Kipp-Zonen Pyranometer is used, periodically
calibrated against international standards. The solar radia-
tion of the rural stations of the AEMET were analyzed
for the purposes of our study to grasp its influence on the
variability of SUHI intensity in the cities of Andalusia.
The data obtained reflect that total daily radiation is some
1.2 times higher in heat wave periods than under normal

conditions. This ratio is reduced to 1.05 times in the LST
and SUHI data collection chart based on Sentinel day, and
up to 1.08 times higher in charts corresponding to Sentinel
night. The atmospheric pressure during the periods of heat
wave was 1.3 times higher than under normal conditions.
These results suggest that Andalusia tends to have higher
atmospheric pressures associated with less cloud cover
during heat wave days, which allows more solar radiation
to reach the earth's surface, as brought out in other studies
(De Boeck et al. 2010; Li et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2019).
The results of the statistical analysis of the SUHI data
obtained by Sentinel day and night in periods of normal
conditions and in heat waves with regard to solar radiation
are indicated in Table 9.
The results of the statistical analysis of the SUHI data
obtained through Sentinel day images point to a statistically
significant relationship above 99% with the independent
variable solar radiation, both under normal atmospheric
conditions and in heat wave periods. The results of the sta-
tistical analysis of the SUHI data obtained through Sentinel
night images indicate a statistically significant relationship
of 99% with the independent variable solar radiation during
periods of normal atmospheric conditions, and above 99%
during heat waves. The cities are located in latitudes where
the sunset during the summer period is after the time of the
Sentinel night.
The values obtained for R2 and the F statistic of the SUHI
data for Sentinel day and night are shown in Table 10. The
data are seen to show good agreement between the depend-
ent and independent variables according to the method

Prob > chi2
< 0.000. The R2 and F values are slightly higher
for heat wave conditions than for normal environmental con-
ditions, which denotes that the relationship between SUHI
and solar radiation is stronger during heat waves.
3.5.1 Wind Speed and Direction Contributions to the SUHI
The wind speed and wind direction data from the rural sta-
tions of the AEMET were analyzed to discern their influence
on the variable intensity of the SUHI in the cities of Anda-
lusia. The direction under normal conditions is from sea to
inland (northward), while during heat wave environmental
conditions, the predominant wind direction is from land to
sea (southward). This means that during the day, in heat wave
conditions, the cool breeze from the sea—which is usual in
normal environmental conditions—does not reach cities, so
that the LST and SUHI increase. The change in wind direc-
tion therefore has a strong impact on the ambient temperature.
Our data reflect a mean daytime wind speed during data
collection using Sentinel day was approximately 1.16 times
higher during periods of normal conditions than during heat
waves. This proportion increases slightly, to 1.18 times,
using Sentinel night.
Tables 11 and 12 offer the results of statistical analysis of
the SUHI data obtained with Sentinel day and night in nor-
mal conditions versus periods of heat wave in terms of wind
speed and direction. The analysis of SUHI data obtained
Table 11 Data panel results
Sentinel day: relationship with
wind speed and direction
with Sentinel day and night images gives no statistically sig-
nificant relationship among the variables analyzed for peri-
ods of normal conditions. In contrast, with Sentinel day and
under heat wave conditions there is a statistically significant
relationship above 99% with the variable wind direction,
slightly reduced to just 99% by Sentinel night.
The values obtained for R2 and the F statistic of the SUHI
data from Sentinel 3A and 3B are shown in Table 13.
The data gathered in periods of normal conditions do not
show good agreement between the dependent variable and
the independent variables according to the method used,
with a level of adjustment lower than 90% significance, as
Prob > chi2
> 0.000. On the contrary, for periods of heat wave,
method used indicates good agreement between the depend-
ent variable and the independent variables, with an adjust-
ment level greater than 99% significance, Prob > chi2
< 0.000.
The R2 and F values are slightly higher in heat wave condi-
tions than in normal environmental conditions, which denotes
that the relationship between SUHI and wind speed and
direction is stronger during heat wave periods.
3.5.2 Increase in the Surface Affected by SUHI During Heat
Wave Period
During heat waves, there is not only an increase in the LST
and an intensification of the SUHI of the analyzed cities,
but larger urban areas are reportedly affected by the SUHI
as well. The average increase in these terms during the heat

Fig. 9 Surface area increases

in urban area by cities
wave periods studied was 15.66% for the urban areas of the
cities of Andalusia.
A substantially greater increase is observed in coastal cit-
ies (22.67%) than in inland cities (8.65%). Figure 9 shows
the affected urban area under normal environmental condi-
tions, under heat wave conditions, and the increase in the
urban area of each city. It should be noted that, in general,
inland cities have larger urban areas affected by SUHI under
normal conditions (85.23%) than coastal cities (56.76%).
This circumstance is possibly motivated by the direction of
the wind, from the sea and towards the land (northward),
which minimizes the LST in the latter cities. Under heat
wave conditions, inland cities also present greater total
urban areas affected (93.88%) than coastal cities (79.43%),
although the highest growth of SUHI occurs in coastal cities.
The change in wind direction (southward) can be considered
the reason for this finding.
4 Discussion
The results presented here, for Sentinel day and night prod-
ucts used to obtain the LST and the SUHI in the cities of
Andalusia, present adequate yields that are consistent with
each other and similar to those provided by similar investiga-
tions (Li et al. 2011; Tan and Li 2015; Sobrino et al. 2016;
Prikaziuk and van der Tol 2019; Yang et al. 2019, 2020b;
Chiang and Ivan 2020; Hu et al. 2020; Venter et al. 2020).
The data obtained with Sentinel day, both for inland
cities and coastal cities, give mean LSTs in rural areas that
are higher than the mean LSTs in urban areas, both in peri-
ods of normal environmental conditions and in periods of
heat wave. Unlike Sentinel day, Sentinel night data report
1 3 that both inland cities and coastal cities have mean LSTs
in rural areas that are lower than the mean LSTs of urban
areas, whether under normal conditions or in heat waves.
There are numerous academic studies that corroborate this
situation between urban and rural temperatures in the early
hours of the morning and at night, motivated by the solar
radiation received (Zakšek et al. 2005; Keramitsoglou
et al. 2011; Li et al. 2011; Feizizadeh and Blaschke 2013;
Li and Bou-Zeid 2013; Mallick et al. 2013; Founda and
Santamouris 2017; Tsou et al. 2017; Barbieri et al. 2018;
Li and Meng 2018; Saaroni et al. 2018; Karakuş, 2019; Wu
et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2019, 2020a, b; Lemus et al. 2020).
The mean values of SUHI obtained through Seninel day
images for inland and coastal cities were negative. This
finding, likewise evoked by other authors, would be deter-
minant of an urban cooling island (Saaroni et al. 2018; Wu
et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2020a). In turn, the mean SUHI
data obtained by Sentinel night for inland and coastal cit-
ies were positive—indicative of an urban heat island, a
phenomenon previously studied (Li et al. 2011; Shwarz
et al. 2011; Lai et al. 2018; Luo and Lau 2018; Zhao et al.
2018; Tewari et al. 2019; Anjos et al. 2020; Huang et al.
2020; Santamouris, 2020). In light of our data, it can be
said that during periods of heat waves there is an intensi-
fication of the SUHI obtained by Sentinel day and night,
both in inland cities and in coastal cities. However, this
intensification is greater with Sentinel day in coastal cit-
ies, and with Sentinel night in inland cities. Numerous
academic studies corroborate the intensification of the
SUHI at night (Gregor et al. 2007; Basara et al. 2010;
House and Santamouris 2011; Founda et al. 2015; Jiang
et al. 2019;) and during the day (House and Santamouris
2011; Founda and Santamouris 2017; Ao et al. 2019; Jiang

et al. 2019; Qiu et al. 2020; Santamouris 2020) in periods
of heat wave.
The data on total daily solar radiation obtained attest to
a 1.2-times increase in periods of heat wave with respect
to normal conditions, corroborated by statistical analysis.
A number of academic studies confirm this association
between solar radiation and SUHI (De Boeck et al. 2010; Li
et al. 2015; Li and Bou-Zeid 2013; Jiang et al. 2019), serving
to validate the data obtained in our investigation.
The wind speed and direction data gathered in our
study denote important changes in the cities of Andalusia
between periods of normal environmental conditions and
periods of heat wave, corroborated by statistical analysis.
The relationship between SUHI and wind speed and direc-
tion are stronger during heat wave periods. Numerous stud-
ies describe such an intensification of the SUHI in the early
hours of the morning and at night (Ackerman and Knox
2012; Li and Bou-Zeid 2013; Li et al. 2015; Ramamurthy
and Bou-Zeid 2017; Jiang et al. 2019; An et al. 2020), thus
validating the data obtained in this investigation.
According to our data, an average urban area in southern
Spain would be affected by the SUHI phenomenon under
normal environmental conditions to the extent of 85.23% in
inland cities and 56.76% in coastal cities. The average urban
surface affected by the SUHI phenomenon under heat wave
conditions would be 15.66% greater, when compared to peri-
ods of normal environmental conditions. Still, this increase
is uneven: 22.67% for coastal cities and 8.65% for inland
cities. Research by other authors (Lemonsu et al. 2015; Ward
et al. 2016; Carvalho et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2019) present-
ing similar values comes to support the results obtained here.
5 Conclusions
In this work, the LST and SUHI were studied by analyz-
ing Sentinel day and night images of the eight capitals of
Andalusia (southern Spain) both in periods of normal envi-
ronmental conditions and in periods of heat wave, during the
years 2019 and 2020. A statistically significant relationship
between the two variables is evidenced.
Our results detect mean LSTs based on Sentinel day and
night in inland cities—both under normal environmental
conditions and in periods of heat wave—that are higher than
the mean LSTs of coastal cities. In turn, the average LSTs
obtained with Sentinel day and night products for both urban
and rural areas are intensified under heat wave environmen-
tal conditions, the increase being greater with Sentinel day
in coastal cities, and with Sentinel night in inland cities.
The mean SUHI obtained with Sentinel day during the
entire study period for the capitals of the Andalusian prov-
inces showed negative values, whereas the mean SUHI
obtained with Sentinel night showed positive values. This
suggests that urban areas are at lower temperatures in the
morning than neighboring rural areas, a phenomenon known
as urban cooling island. Then, during the evening, the urban
areas are at higher temperatures than the adjacent rural areas,
producing an urban heat island. During heat wave periods,
an intensification of the SUHI obtained with Sentinel day
and night is detected for both inland cities and coastal cities,
but it is greater for coastal cities with Sentinel day, and for
inland cities with Sentinel night.
Within the scope of the environmental factors studied,
our results attest to a positive and statistically significant
relationship between SUHI and solar radiation, and between
SUHI and the direction of the wind, intensified in periods of
heat wave as compared to periods of normal environmental
conditions. Wind speed turns out to be a positive and statisti-
cally significant variable, but only in periods of normal con-
ditions and according to the data from Sentinel night images.
Our results detect that the surface of the urban area
affected by the SUHI phenomenon under normal environ-
mental conditions is greater for inland cities than for coastal
cities. Notwithstanding, under heat wave conditions, the
intensified SUHI entails a larger surface area, this phenom-
enon being greater for coastal cities than for inland cities.
